 ```javascript

 const watsonxIntegrationID = "278xxxxxxxxxxxcb8296e";//use your integrationID of watsonx assistant
const watsonxRegion = "us-south";//use your region of watsonx assistant
const watsonxServiceInstanceID = "fc31xxxxxxxxxd711a9";//use your serviceInstanceID of watsonx assistant

export {watsonxIntegrationID, watsonxRegion, watsonxServiceInstanceID};

```

Now, you can run the application:

### `npm start`
