A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 616. Civil liability for willful noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ] ( a ) In general. Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ; or ( B ) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or {$1000.00}, whichever is greater ; ( 2 ) such amount of punitive damages as the court may allow ; and ( 3 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court\n\nOutput:\nI viewed my consumer report and the credit reporting is not accurate because it violates the FCRA law.\n\nInput:\nCash central has put this debt on my credit multiple times. I found the last complaint with the CFPB involving XXXX XXXX that resulted in the removal. Complaint ending in XXXX. At that time Cash Central did not supply XXXX XXXX with documentation confirming the debt and it was removed due to the debt being erroneously put on my report. You can find this compliant that was submitted to the CFPB on XX/XX/2018. Cash central has a history of putting incorrect information on peoples credit reports which can be found at this link XXXX XXXX XXXX At this point, Nothing further should be needed from me. This debt has been proven countless times to not be mine. Again, when a debt is found to be erroneous, it is illegal to re report that same debt to the credit bureaus.

I called them and they said it would  take 10 days just to look at the file. I am very upset with their process. I would like help to get this erroneous error off my credit report. The error is showing dated XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with the company XX/XX/XXXX and they said they did not report this and it would take 10 days to have their team look into it. I will be losing the house that I have put a down payment on and I will lose my down if this does not get resolved in a timely manner. I have filed a complaint with this company previously and you helped with a positive outcome but again they are messing with my credit.\n\nOutput:\nI applied for a home loan and a late payment on a previous loan is incorrectly  there in my credit report.\n\nInput:\n",

A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. 616.

Cash central has a history of putting incorrect information on peoples credit reports which can be found at this link XXXX XXXX XXXX At this point, Nothing further should be needed from me.

The error is showing dated XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with the company XX/XX/XXXX and they said they did not report this and it would take 10 days to have their team look into it. I will be losing the house that I have put a down payment on and I will lose my down if this does not get resolved in a timely manner.
