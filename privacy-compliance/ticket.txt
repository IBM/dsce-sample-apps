Hi I am Ravi Dube. I am writing to you to report an unauthorised transaction on my credit card. On March 30th 2023, I noticed a charge of $1,000 on my credit card statement that I did not authorise. The transaction was made at a restaurant in New York, while I was in California on that day. I am concerned about the security of my account and I would appreciate if you could investigate this matter promptly. Please contact me at my phone number (123)456-7890 or email me at ravi.dube@email.com to provide me with an update on the investigation. My card number is 3572267594198019. I look forward to hear from you soon.
