## 🤔 The Problem


XYZ Retail Store is a leading player in consumer goods retail. While XYZ Store has built a strong reputation for product variety and quality, its legacy inventory management and manual forecasting processes have created a cumbersome experience for both customers and store managers. Customers frequently encounter empty shelves, experience missed purchases, and face inconsistent product availability. Meanwhile, store managers are burdened with manual forecasting, reactive ordering, and fragmented inventory data, making it difficult to anticipate demand, reduce lost sales, and maintain customer loyalty.
