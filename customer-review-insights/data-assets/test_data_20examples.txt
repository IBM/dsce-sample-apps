Please lower the prices.
Excellent response dealing with child seat. Just called them (200) 123-4567 and its done 
all went quite smoothly... it was Enterprise, so they even picked me up to get the car... it was very convenient.
Customer service is not good. called them (200) 123-4567
Customer is important for the enjoyment of the car.  If it's a bad experience we won't return to that company if we can avoid it - they should remember abotut this
They were actually very nice. It was in Rome and there was a language barrier, but we overcame it.
They provided the best service thus far. They are very friendly and helpful. I have rented from other companies before both cheaper and more expensive.
I recently rented a car and they were outstanding.  The customer service rep was very helpful and courteous.  They even let me extend my rental by a couple of hours for no charge at all. I was very pleased with my experience and I would go back.
It was okay, we got the car quickly, which is the most important thing
They had problem to find reservation number, so whole process took too long time.
Most windows were closed.
The woman at the counter was friendly and tried to accommodate me as best she could. The counter was close to the terminal and the whole thing was quick and expedient.
it was fine, had no problem at all.
Person very friendly but only person working counter. His name is Richard Tuffy
It was fine.
car cost more because I didn't pay when I reserved it
Please stop increasing the prices.
Wonderful experience - the rental and whole process was seamless
My experience was positive .The thing didnt like was returning the car with full tank.  It was time consuming, but didn't want to pay fill-up charge to the rental company.
fast service. Call the at (200) 123-3456
