All the people I dealt with were pleasant and helpful. Carl Johnson
Very nice, free upgrade Thanks Ravi Ahuja.
My last experience was  seamless.  The only thing I didn't like was having to fill the tank with gas before turning it in.  It was inconvenient, but I didn't want to pay the hefty fill-up charge to the rental company.
My experience up to date was  good.  It was inconvenient to return car clean, but I had to pay the hefty charge for rental.
I was happy that we arrived very late and there was still a live person to help us get our rental.  
We had no problems with the car, and returned it easily.
