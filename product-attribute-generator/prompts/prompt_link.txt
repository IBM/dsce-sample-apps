Analyze the provided Product Details and extract all possible specifications of the product. Format the extracted data exclusively as JSON metadata, adhering to the following strict guidelines:

Output strictly in JSON format:

Do not include any additional text, comments, or explanations outside the JSON output.
JSON structure rules:

Represent each specification as a single key-value pair at the top level of the JSON object.
Ensure that all keys have their first letter in capital case and contain no underscores (e.g., Product Name instead of product_name or Product_name).
Use only strings for both keys and values.
If multiple values exist for the same specification, consolidate them under a single key as a comma-separated string.
Avoid creating duplicate keys.
Formatting and consistency:

Exclude escape characters in the response (e.g., no \" or \\).
Ensure the output is valid JSON and strictly adheres to the defined key formatting.
