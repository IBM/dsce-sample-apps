We expect it will change a lot in next few weeks.\n\nBest Regards,\nKrista\n\nHi Krista and Scott, I understand we have very minor work left for milestone 1 features. Could you please share the final milestone 1 containers with Ravi so that he can build the beta/demo/preview environment for us? We’re doing it this way instead of a regular beta. Thanks!

    "input_text": "Customer: Hello, I'm interested in learning more about the insurance policy you offer. Could you please tell me about the coverage and benefits it provides?\n\nAgent: Of course! Our policy provides coverage for inpatient hospitalization, which means it covers medical expenses incurred during your stay in a hospital. This includes treatments, surgeries, and other necessary medical services.\n\nCustomer: That sounds good. Now, is there a copayment involved in this policy?\n\nAgent: Yes, there is a copayment requirement. A copayment is a fixed amount that you would need to pay out of pocket for each medical service or treatment covered by the policy. The specific copayment amount will be mentioned in your policy documents.\n\nCustomer: I see. One more thing, does this policy cover dental treatment?\n\nAgent: I'm sorry, but dental treatment is not covered under this particular policy. It focuses on inpatient hospitalization expenses only. If you're interested in dental coverage, we can discuss other policy options that might suit your needs.\n\nCustomer: Alright, thanks for clarifying that. Could you tell me about the policy renewal period?\n\nAgent: Certainly! The policy renewal period for this plan is one year. Once the policy term is over, you'll need to renew it to continue enjoying the benefits provided under the policy.\n\nCustomer: That's clear. Now, let's say I need to make a claim. What are the steps involved in processing a claim?\n\nAgent: If you need to make a claim, it's important to notify AllBright Insurance Company within one week of hospitalization or treatment. You can contact our claims department, and they will guide you through the claim submission process. You'll need to provide relevant medical documents and invoices for the expenses incurred during the treatment.\n\nCustomer: Got it, I'll keep that in mind. Also, I live in the 77001 area. Can you tell me which hospitals are part of your network in that area?\n\nAgent: Certainly! In the 77001 area, we have TEXAS HEALTHCARE CENTER as one of the network hospitals where you can avail cashless treatment as per the terms of your policy.\n\nCustomer: That's great to know. One last question, does this policy cover international hospitalization?\n\nAgent: I'm afraid not. This policy provides coverage only for inpatient hospitalization within the country. If you require coverage for international hospitalization, we can explore other insurance options that cater to such needs.\n\nCustomer: I understand. Thank you for all the information. If I decide to get this policy but later change my mind, can I terminate it if required?\n\nAgent: Yes, you can certainly terminate the policy if required. However, it's essential to review the policy documents for specific details about the termination process and any applicable terms or conditions.\n\nCustomer: Okay, I'll make sure to check that. Thank you for your help and for answering all my questions.\n\nAgent: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out at any time. We're here to help you make the best decision for your insurance needs."
