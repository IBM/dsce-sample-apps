initialing here

extensions thereof. CONSULTANT may maintain the required post agreement coverage by renewal
or purchase of prior acts or tail coverage. This provision is contingent upon post agreement coverage

this Agreement. For purposes of interpreting this requirement, a cost not exceeding 100% of the last
annual policy premium during the term of this Agreement in order to purchase prior acts or tail

during the term of this contract. In the event said insurance coverage expires at any time or times
during the term of this contract, the CONSULTANT agrees to provide at least thirty (30) days prior
notice to said expiration date; and a new Certificate of Insurance evidencing insurance coverage as
provided for herein, for not less than either the remainder of the term of the contract, or for a period
of not less than one (1) year. New Certificates of Insurance are subject to the approval of the

HARASSMENT. The COMMISSION maintains a strict policy prohibiting unlawful harassment, including
sexual harassment, in any form, including verbal, physical and visual harassment by any employee,
supervisor, manager, officer or Board member, or agent of the employer. Vendors, CONSULTANTs, and
consultants shall not engage in conduct that has an effect of unreasonably interfering with a COMMISSION
employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.

10. LICENSES. If a license of any kind is required of CONSULTANT, its employees, agents, or sub
CONSULTANTs by Federal or State law, CONSULTANT warrants that such license has been obtained, is
valid and in good standing, that CONSULTANT shall keep it in effect at all times during the terms of this
Agreement, and that any applicable bond has been posted in accordance with all applicable laws and
regulations.
11. INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS. CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and
considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent
CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance
(workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes. CONSULTANT is not entitled to
any employee benefits. COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the
manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.
PRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and
means of accomplishing the result contracted for.
SECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise
over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct
occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a
specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the
particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION
supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is
engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the
job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather
than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are
creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j)
The COMMISSION conducts public business.
It is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent
CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate
that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT.
By their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered
judgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT.

Contract Code 10115, et seq. and Title 21, California Code of Regulations, Chapter 21, Section 2500 et seq.,
