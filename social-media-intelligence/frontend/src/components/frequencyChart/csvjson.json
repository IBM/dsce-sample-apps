Unable to comprehend simple responses, it parrots back the infuriating directive to seek help online \u201a\u00c4\u00ec a wild goose chase leading back to where it began.\n\n This cycle of confusion is not just inefficient; it's a complete disregard for the customer's time and needs.\n\nThe irony is stark. On the one hand, the website insists on calling in to cancel a warranty. On the other hand, the AI phone bot, in its astounding ineptitude, claims customer support is out of reach for this task. The bot, rather than being an aid, serves as a gatekeeper, deflecting and deterring, not assisting.\n\nThis is more than just a technological misstep; it's symptomatic of a larger issue within TelcoC. The AI's only real accomplishment seems to be an efficient mechanism for customer frustration. It's a glaring example of a billion-dollar company's inability to implement AI with the finesse and intelligence that modern technology demands. \n\nAdding insult to injury is the company's tactic of unscrupulously charging for services never solicited. The Norton device security charge, the coerced extended warranty for a new phone - these are not just oversights but deliberate strategies to extract more from the customer. It raises a critical question: Why does TelcoC think it's acceptable to engage in what amounts to stealthy financial extraction?\n\nThe future looms large with a disturbing possibility: If this is the direction in which corporations like TelcoC are taking AI, we're in for a grim era where technological advancement serves corporate greed over consumer need. It paints a bleak picture of a future where human interaction is supplanted by robotic apathy, and customer service becomes intentionally frustrating in the hope that customers give up, because their voyage through automated responses, lead nowhere.\n\n@TelcoC @TelcoCsupport  #AIFail #CorporateGreed @TelcoCBusiness",

Year Two will be even better! @playontabletop  is excited to host the 2nd Warhammer 40,000 Narrative Tournament at Games Con Canada Powered by @TelcoC . In our narrative events, we focus on having fun with custom missions and interactive elements (meaning there will be shenanigans). Members of the Play On Tabletop team will be guiding players through a custom narrative.  Last year players were put into teams, pitted against fun-focused opponents, and had to dodge destructive shots from a Warlord Titan that wreaked havoc on the battlefield. We are planning more mayhem for this upcoming event.\n\n Working with Games Con Canada and @RedClawGaming  this event has expanded to 100 players, double from last year. \n\n A ticket to this Narrative Event includes a full All-Access 3-Day Pass to Games Con Canada 2024 valued at $108.00.\n\n Our Limited Stock VIP ticket includes Exclusive Swag, entry into the Narrative Event, and the All-Access Weekend Pass. \n \n For your tickets please visit: gameconcanada.com\/\n\n #warhammer40k #Edmonton #events #Wargaming #tabletopgames #",
