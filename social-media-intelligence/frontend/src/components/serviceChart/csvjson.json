I lost count how many times this has happened now.\n\nWhen you complain that the problem is on multiple TPIA providers, and even Rogers customers, they tell you to contact your TPIA provider or buy their more expensive service for them to care to escalate the matter. If a TPIA customer tries to call out Rogers for their shenanigans and decrepit network, they tell them to contact their provider, who in turn tells the customer that it's a Rogers infrastructure issue, which is outside the scope of the any TPIA.\n\nRogers can only be held accountable for their network being decrepit if you're their customer directly. If you're not their customer, then there is no support or accountability because there is no way for TPIA customers to escalate a network congestion issue. This means that they are second rate customers who get sub-standard service. This in and of itself is a major unfair competitive advantage.\n\nAlso, if you're switching from a TPIA, Rogers will offer you the same price your TPIA provider can give you for the immediate moment, but only if you sign a 24 month contract, and in that contract, it states that Rogers may reserve the right to increase their services as it's technically regular price, less a promotional bill discount, and that the original base price can change at any time during that contract. Literally, this means that Rogers may reserve the right to bait and switch you, and they do it all the time.\n\nWhy has @CRTCeng not come down on Rogers for this now?

    "input": "Therein lies the problem... @startca has already made it crystal clear that the problem is with your network and as such, there is nothing they can do. How sleazy do you have to be to use \"you're a TPIA customer\" as an excuse to not be held accountable for upgrading YOUR network?\n\nNot only that, but in order to be in any way competitive, you require that I sign a 2 year contract. At the end of the 2 year period, your service jacks up to $40/mo more for your service... and that's assuming you don't bait and switch during the course of the contract, which you are famous for doing. \n\nUnless you can lock in that promo price as a guarantee for the duration of the contract, I refuse to switch, as I refuse to be baited into paying more money for service that won't consistently get the speed that I pay for. We'll see what the #CRTC has to say about the fact that you are now outright making excuses in order to avoid upgrading your decrepit network that has been sold to beyond what it has the capacity to handle.\n\nWhenther I were a @Rogers customer directly or TPIA makes no difference. I would still not be getting the speed that I pay for because your network is too congested to handle the load.... And your answer to this is paying even more to subscribe to your service directly. This kind of shady and under handed tactic should be illegal.\n\nLiterally, your solution to the fact that your network is too congested to handle the traffic load is to try to up sell me to your service and make me pay YOU more than I pay my current provider. Rather than actually escalate the issue to the appropriate people, you're trying to sell me a more expensive service that won't meet my needs because your network in my neighbourhood CANNOT HANDLE THE SPEED YOU'RE SELLING!\n\nI am officially DISGUSTED with you guys, and I'm  starting to understand why I went TPIA many years ago in the first place. If you sneeze the wrong way, you hike your prices, and if you're in a term contract for a promotional price, it sucks to be you because you're paying for it. This is downright sleazy and should be illegal.\n\nFIX YOUR DAMN NETWORK!!! YOUR NETWORK IN MY NEIGHBOURHOOD IS TOO CONGESTED TO HANDLE THE TRAFFIC DEMAND BEING PUT ON IT. CHANGING TO ROGERS DIRECTLY WILL NOT SOLVE THIS ISSUE!\n\n#ShadyBusiness #CrookedRogers #RogersSucks #RogersIsAScam",

It seems that no matter the area you're in, there are issues with your service that render it unreliable, unstable, or otherwise not as advertised.\n\nIn my parents' neighbourhood that I just moved out of (Golden Meadow Dr & Golden Meadow Cres, Kitchener, ON) you have finally upgraded the backbone to be able to handle the network load, however most of the lines running from the different taps (such as the one on my parents' front lawn) are an average of 22 - 25 years old. One by one, they are beginning to fail, and every time this happens, it causes stability and reliability issues for everyone in the area. It's a never ending cycle. One gets fixed with a temp line, and the next thing you know, another one starts to go and everyone has the same problem again. It's been like this for some time because #Rogers seems to be incapable of doing any sort of preventative maintenance on their network... only maintenance when something has failed completely.\n\nNow, I have recently moved into a different area (Ottawa St N & McGee Ave, Kitchener, ON) and we have a different issue that's equally as frustrating because things are not as advertised. While I have not yet had any stability issues like I did at my parents' place, the network here seems to be over congested. In other words, between #Rogers customers and #TPIA traffic, your network has been sold to beyond what it has the capacity to handle. The result is that especially for higher speed tier customers, their service falls short of what it should be, especially when the network is in greater demand. A couple of times now, you have actually illegally throttled me because of this, which I find even more unacceptable. It's effectively deliberately cheating me out of what I pay for to try to cover up your mismanagement of your network... but that's a topic for another time.\n\nWho would one have to reach out to at Rogers to get the ball rolling on doing proper network upgrades for both capacity and stability/reliability? I just want my internet to consistently perform at the speed that I pay for, no matter the time of day, or day of the week, and for it to be both stable and reliable. Is this too much to ask? #CRTC\n\nI pay for 1000/50... This happens at lunch time every day. It gets even worse Friday  - Sunday. It's the same pattern for everyone in this area on the same days of the week every week. Things are actually looking \"good\" (if that's what you want to call it) right now.",
