17/03/17,  The staff were very friendly Anybody booking a hotel room in central London should manage their expectations of the size of room they are going to get The room here was Bijou but was adequate for my purposes Room was saved by having rainfall shower rather than a bath and by having a queen bed rather than a full size double but since I was travelling alone this was fine The hotel is within walking distance of Pimlico tube and in a very nice area of London,Booking.com,Belgrave
14/03/17, Couldn t fill kettle under tap Bed was a little soft   Room was described as compact and was exactly that But enough room for bed bathroom and hospitality tray and TV Liked decaf coffee being present without having to ask for it Check in was very friendly Included Continental breakfast was perfectly adequate ,Booking.com,Belgrave

03/03/17, The sink location underneath a shelf in the bathroom meant I was unable to wash my face without having my head on the shelf Not enough space to store my wash things in the bathroom Lots of lights in the room however no main light left the room very dim Only mirror in the room on the wardrobe   The bed was comfortable Friendly staff ,Booking.com,Belgrave
02/03/17, Only issue was on last night when the occupants of room above were moving about a lot in the night and disturbed my wife s sleep Suspect it was noisy due to laminate floors and lack of noise insulation below the top surface or ceiling of room to dampen the sound Not entirely hotel fault as cannot control guests nocturnal movements and they were not being loud and rowdy in any way but perhaps had a middle of the night start Consider we were unlucky to have those guests above us for that night and it would not put us off returning another time  Breakfast was excellent quality and replenished by staff who were both efficient and courteous Whole hotel was clean and welcoming with very friendly staff Good pleasant location away from noise and disturbance of the city but within close walking distance to most of what you want to see as a tourist in London ,Booking.com,Belgrave

25/02/17, Below average breakfast definitely not at a 4 star hotel level Asked to pay at check in pretty unusual for a 4 star hotel reception staff not very attentive and customer oriented Hard to identify the location in absence of a visible logo except a very discrete one on the column next to the entrance no ashtray in front no trash can in the lobby   Clean good room facilities comfortable bed Excellent coffee maker cell phone companion with free wifi and calls ,Booking.com,Belgrave

07/02/17, Nets on bathroom window not just blinds And the bedroom window doors were faulty very difficult to close once opened   Room cleaned daily and drinking facilities replenished daily Very good that we were able to leave our bags behind reception before check in ,Booking.com,Belgrave
06/02/17, The noise of the floor above us when someone was walking was quite annoying and disrupted our sleep i think it was a cleaners room above us there were a lot of footsteps from 7 onwards in the morning   Staff were friendly the beds were comfy location was good and breakfast was good ,Booking.com,Belgrave
06/02/17,  Excellent hotel in a perfect location if you are visiting the Apollo Theatre to watch a show About 10 minute walk from Victoria Coach Station and walking distance to Buckingham Palace If you don t fancy walking to Buckingham Palace a cab is less than 10 and the train station is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel Staff are very friendly and allowed us to keep our luggage after check out to save us carrying it around the city with us Will definitely be returning the next time I m in London ,Booking.com,Belgrave

13/12/16, The heating was probably not working very well and it was rather noisy The strong noise coming from upstairs partly due to the insufficient floor insulation from other guests   Cleanliness decent size single room by London standards location very close to Victoria Train and Coach Stations The continental breakfast was very good and varied including lots of fresh fruit yoghurt and croissants In may case it was included in the room price but otherwise it was very reasonably priced by London standards about GBP 11 for a the self service continental option but if you paid some extra pounds you could have some cooked options ,Booking.com,Belgrave

31/10/16, Hospitality WHAT A JOKE The location and rooms maybe ok but I ve never been treated so badly in my life I checked into the belgrave in Pimlico on Saturday afternoon after paying upfront for my room and as customary swiped my credit card on arrival to cover any additional costs that may be incurred That evening my wife and I went into the west end and unfortunately had our bag containing all of our cash credit and debit cards car keys and mobile phone stolen We were devastated Our devastation never ended there In the morning we went down to reception and explained what had happened and asked if the hotel could possibly help us out and charge my credit card which had already been swiped for 50 00 and refund us 50 00 in cash in order to give us enough money to make our way home We were informed that this was not possible as anything charged to a room has to be accounted for by the sale of a product I asked if I could then have 50 00 paid into their bank account and if they could then give me the 50 00 in cash as I was completely stranded This suggestion was met with a complete and absolute NO I asked if there were any staff member including the indifferent receptionist and duty manager who we were trying to explain our predicament to if they would be prepared to help us out They both treated us as though we were tramps walking off the street asking for some change for our next bottle of cider not like paying guests who had just been robbed and still traumatised At no point did any staff member offer any form of sympathy or help but rather treated us with complete disdain and contempt We checked out of this hotel without having breakfast or even a cup of tea as I was not prepared to give these disgusting people another penny of my money I have never been made to feel so cheap or bad in my life THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS HOTEL ARE A DISGRACE TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY  ,Booking.com,Belgrave

20/09/16, No mirrors near a plug socket not good when trying to dry or straighten hair When we went down for breakfast we were automatically charged for the continental breakfast but once we were given the menu they had other options we only wanted a small breakfast of scrambled eggs on toast which was 5 90 yet we had been charged 11 90 for the continental and the 5 90 would of been on top of this Once we explained we only wanted the scrambled eggs the other was refunded and the breakfast was amended this option also included hot drinks   Very quiet location only 10mins from attractions transports links Read reviews saying the rooms were small but we found the oom a decent size which were very clean and tidy no wardrobe space but for a few days did not cause us any issue maybe a longer stay or a family this may cause concern breakfast was nice once a issue was resolved ,Booking.com,Belgrave

08/09/16, When asked whether we could have a 12 00 check out the answer was a very curt No without even checking arrival times or occupanc Earliest check in is at 15 00 so surely one hour s grace period for one room cannot hurt their operations mcan it   Plenty of choice for a continental breakfast and room 108 was quite spacious even w a balcony,Booking.com,Belgrave

12/07/16, We have been charged twice both on the date of our arrival being 07 07 16 for 2 nights We paid 306 cash as soon as we arrived to the receptionist by the name of Valentina She was seeking directions from her colleague at the time so we assume she was relatively new I can t recall her issuing a receipt for the cash We always pay cash because we have a Travel Card We were asked to give details of our credit card as well Our credit card has been debited with the Australian equivalent of 306 as well Any assistance to recover this over payment immediately would be greatly appreciated   Andre provided us with excellent service from the breakfast bar He provided us with a takeaway breakfast because of a 6am departure on 9th July Abdul the night receptionist was very helpful would have given top rating for staff if we hadn t been charged twice ,Booking.com,Belgrave
11/07/16, The wooden floors in the guest rooms mean that it is quite noisy hearing other guests walking about on other floors which kept me awake until it subsided   The staff were very friendly and the rooms were nicely presented including nice touches like the coffee machine The continental breakfast was nice ,Booking.com,Belgrave
09/07/16, Perhaps one of the physically smallest spaces I can remember staying in in a while Navigating the room by more than one person is a real challenge and neither I nor my partner are large people Although in the pictures they look remarkably modern some of the furniture in the room is in fact rather harried and somewhat dated   Nice spot fairly well located certain aesthetic touches were nice more or less calm environment air conditioning was strong and effective desk staff were friendly and accommodating ,Booking.com,Belgrave
09/07/16, Did not like ensuite Far too small with no room to wash face properly due to shelf above sink and tap design No room to dry oneself after shower and no room for own toiletries Room itself clean but compact with no place to rest suitcases except the bed Fine for 1 night but would have reservations if staying more than 1 night Plus no HD channels   The continental breakfast was lovely The bed was comfortable The staff very friendly and welcoming Nice quiet location only a short walk from travel connections ,Booking.com,Belgrave

08/07/16, All I can think of is the size of the room for the first 6 nights Would have liked it a bit bigger so we could move comfortably round the bed   The breakfasts were great good value especially as they were included in the price Our room was quite small but comfy and very clean We then stayed an extra 2 nights after a trip to Europe and booked a Junior Suite Lovely views of the city from that room and of course a lot bigger ,Booking.com,Belgrave

28/06/16, The hotel was extremely hot Our air con in our room wouldnt work from the terminal in the room so we had to get reception to put it on it then worked which was brilliant but a pain to keep asking reception to put it on for us   The staff were fantastic and so friendly ,Booking.com,Belgrave
26/06/16, a matchbox of a room The shower door leaked The hairdryer was broken and after two telephone requests l had to go to reception who said it was the first they had heard of it An apology would have helped On the other hand the breakfasts were excellent  ,Booking.com,Belgrave

22/06/16, I actually found it a little hard to find from Victoria as its out the back way There were building works which meant I could go where the sat nav was saying But got there in the end   The room was really lovely and all the staff I met were really friendly and helpful A really special place ,Booking.com,Belgrave
21/06/16, everything was amazing apart from no hotel restaurant But what a fabulous spot   It was just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Vitoria but close enough that you re never to far from the real London streets The hotel does not do food but with French restaurant Grumbles is just round the corner and take my word for it the food and wine is to die for ,Booking.com,Belgrave

06/06/16, I think 11 for the continental and 14 for the full English breakfast is a bit steep and I would not bother if bought separately The deal we had included breakfast and so overall was good value for such a location between Victoria and Pimlico stations   Modern feel within a traditional Georgian town house Helpful staff Comfortable and quiet room Good breakfast if part of the room rate ,Booking.com,Belgrave
05/06/16, Pillows a bit hard but staff changed them and gave us extra ones immediately   Wonderful continental breakfast with cooked options at only a little extra charge Friendly staff ,Booking.com,Belgrave
04/06/16, The queen sized bed sagged a bit on the side that is apparently most often used and the carpet was stained The room was quite small but we managed to accommodate our luggage by rearranging chairs   The No 24 bus runs directly between Trafalgar Square and Belgrave Road Also the bathroom was quite stylish with a good shower once we figured it out ,Booking.com,Belgrave

01/06/16, Housekeeping could have been better Bed mattress was well used and uncomfortable and should have been replaced There is little variety and little choice for breakfast although it is possible to order full English breakfast for an additional four pounds We had expected that they remembered our room number after five mornings but it was obviously too much to ask We had expected to get more value for money We paid after all 125 pounds per night   Staff at reception and breakfast room is helpful and attentive It s quiet and peaceful at the hotel but badly soundproofed between floors The wireless internet worked fine The hotel is close to Tate Britain and subways with few stops to all major sights There are not so many restaurants nearby but try the pub White Swan or the Indian restaurant Millbank Spice in Vauxhall Bridge Road which has great food and service The hotel serves breakfast only ,Booking.com,Belgrave

11/05/16, I really hate to say anything bad about this hotel but unfortunately there is one thing The soundproofing in the floors ceilings is not very good at all so if the person in the room above you walks across the floor it is very noisy A real shame as everything else is wonderful but not recommended for light sleepers   This is an excellent little hotel Very modern and newly fitted rooms spotlessly clean fantastically helpful and friendly staff and a very good breakfast spread cooked breakfasts are a small supplement Difficult to believe it is so good when it is cheaper than some hotels in the area which are much worse ,Booking.com,Belgrave

20/04/16, Another coffee tea machine toaster would be handy Mirror above sockets in bedroom room 410   The Belgrave is a lovely Hotel enjoyed our stay here Really enjoyed the continental breakfast however there was always a queue for the toaster coffee tea machine Bedroom was lovely but could have done with another mirror especially above the sockets so I could see when using the hairdryer Room 410 ,Booking.com,Belgrave

02/04/16, Our room was 105 which was right next door to the lift was woken a few times in the night when it was being used So wouldn t recommend that room the view wasn t great but only there one night   The hotel decor was very good the continental breakfast had lots of choice,Booking.com,Belgrave
31/03/16, The room was freezing and took a while to heat up The heating would also switch off on its own during the night so just as the room would warm up it would get cold again quickly   Breakfast was lovely ,Booking.com,Belgrave

29/03/16, Although we got an upgrade from a standard to an exectuive room the room itself was rather small bathroom surprisingly spacious There is a minibar installed in the wardrobe that makes it impossibe to hang any clothes although there were like 6 hanger We stayed on the first floor facing Belgrave Road The road is quite busy and opening the window is not really an option The building structure seems to be a weak spot overall We heard all sorts of noise from other guests Common problem in the UK but not very enjoyable When we went for breakfast at 9 15 the room was full and we had to sit upstairs next to the reception More convenient than the very busy room downstairs but with guests checking out close by and its a rather long way to the buffet We left a bag in the bathroom when we left and phoned the hotel two hours later The room had not been cleaned at that point and we were supposed to be called back after the item was retrieved but nothing happened When we got back to the hotel the reception staff was not aware of our problem At least they joined the houskeeping in searching the rubbish for our bag that was eventually found there Not the perfect way of handling it In sum the hotel is quite ok but it is not a hidden treasure   Good location to Victoria Station and Pimlico Room appeared to be newly refurbished bathroom was well equipped and spacious shower had pleasant water pressure Breakfast selection was ok nothing special though ,Booking.com,Belgrave
28/03/16, Sharp hard plastic transparent fire exit signs that hang from the ceiling Cut my head immediately on arrival   Very good breakfast included in the price Nicely decorated clean spacious room ,Booking.com,Belgrave

10/03/16, Has there been a management change I came away with the perception that there has been a marked change in attitude of the desk staff at book in and again at check out Gone were the cheerful helpful and pleasant receptionists I d met on previous occasions and in place were efficient impersonal and cheerless robots   This was my third stay and the previous experiences have been exemplary maybe this was just an off day Comfortable clean room and good breakfast ,Booking.com,Belgrave
10/03/16, The room on arrival seemed a bit claustrophobic but everything was laid out very well considering the tight space   The staff were all very helpful and friendly The room was quiet despite being by the lift ,Booking.com,Belgrave
01/03/16, This is the second time we booked at the hotel Last year we had a very good experience with our accommodation and we decided to book the same hotel for this year trip It was a huge disappointment for us The elevator was out of order for all the 6 days that we were there The towels were dirty The cups for the coffee they were dirty too and I also asked for clean ones The toilet wasn t flush and they send someone from the staff to fix it as soon as we arrived One night around midnight there was a false alarm in the hotel and we had to run out of the hotel with our pajamas while we were sleeping Last but not least the day we left we asked the hotel to book a taxi for us we told them we need a taxi that accept visas since we run out of cash they called a taxi and the taxi didn t accept visas When we told to the taxi driver can you please take as to an ATM he denied and he said he don t have time to look for an ATM so he stop the car while he was driving and he asked my husband to go out and go find an ATM before he take us to the bus stop where the bus was waiting for us to take us to the airport my husband went out of the car he found an ATM he had money and we paid him in order to take us to our destination When we arrived he didn t even give us a hand with the luggages and he charged us 22 pounds instead of 6 pounds that we paid last year and of what we used to paid almost everyday during our stay there The hotel was very irresponsible with this and made us feel very uncomfortable and almost miss the bus to airport due to the fact that they didn t care about our request I am very disappointed and I don t know if I will be able to consider visiting the hotel again  ,Booking.com,Belgrave
28/02/16, Unlike other hotels in the road this hotel is quite discreet so remember the address number when looking for it   Recently refurbished and smart Very comfortable though small standard room adequate for us Excellent continental breakfast Staff friendly and helpful ,Booking.com,Belgrave

26/02/16, A better quality of tea bag in the room really the most minor of points   The room was small but perfectly formed I did not need for anything during my stay the bed was very comfortable and the room surprisingly quiet for central London The location was perfect for my meetings and the decor and cleanliness mean I would even consider coming back for a leisure stay ,Booking.com,Belgrave

16/02/16, We received a very good deal on this room right at 50 for the night For that money it s worth 5 stars However I m well aware the room typically goes for much more I wouldn t pay the typical going rate for a night s stay Several reasons the pillows are awful Flat and rather hard With only one per person we both woke with stiff necks We did try to obtain a couple of extra but there were none to be found The rooms could also do with better sound proofing Aside from the unlucky draw of being placed by the lift we awoke multiple times owing to music and other noises coming through the walls   The hotel and room were well appointed and there were many nice touches Breakfast was particularly fantastic and the shower is ace ,Booking.com,Belgrave
16/02/16, The manager on duty was not very friendly We were first given a super small dark room down a narrow stair facing a backyard corner Obviously one of their few standard rooms compared to the other rooms these do not match the standard I also chose this hotel because of the Nespresso machine they have in the rooms Surprise because the standard rooms don t have them After some discussion the manager offered us an upgrade to a bigger room with more light and a Nespresso machine in it but this was at an additional cost and not complimentary Another negative point the air condition in the room worked very poorly and we found out that it can apparently be manually overrun by the reception I froze the whole first night and had to ask for an additional blanket for the second night Too late as I woke up with a cold the next morning   The location is excellent a few minutes walk from Pimlico station Nice design and very clean Good breakfast ,Booking.com,Belgrave

29/10/15, I was not impressed with breakfast on the second day We had continental breakfast included in the price and whilst on the first day there were no issues on the second day I was very disappointed We came down at 9am and we had to wait 5 minutes for a table which would have been ok if that was the only issue We were told by the staff that breakfast had been on since 6 30am and it was pretty much our fault that we had come at the busiest time Nothing was mentioned to us at check in that breakfast would be busy at certain times also forgive me for not wanting to get up at 6am when I was on a long weekend city break After we were seated we then had to wait a further 10 minutes for plates as the kitchen ran out causing a mass scramble between everyone when they did re appear and subsequently quickly vanish meaning other people had to wait even longer for plates While we had our breakfast there were no mugs available meaning we were not able to have a hot drink with our breakfast I would probably look at having breakfast elsewhere or set your alarm   I was very impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room ,Booking.com,Belgrave

27/10/15, I arrived for breakfast at 10 05am with breakfast being advertised until 10 30 As I arrived there were numerous guests all milling about trying to figure out what one was supposed to do nobody appeared to know or understand the protocol In the end I took a seat and waited for staff to serve me After ten minutes a member of staff came out and announced to a confused guest that chef had finished cooking breakfast and there would be no more served This as you can imagine nearly caused a riot and led myself and five other guests to complain to reception After much confusion and further waiting I was served with a cooked breakfast resembling something that frankly my child could have created At no point did anybody receive an explanation or an apology for the chaos A simple act of which would have gone a long way   Location ,Booking.com,Belgrave

16/11/09,"We stayed for two nights at the Dorset Square hotel recently. We managed to get a very good deal through Lastminute.com on one of their 'mystery hotels' - well worth booking this way, in the booking I had requested after reading other reviews that our room was higher than the 2nd floor and would be suitable for a couple - these requests were met - we had room 407 on the top floor, small but perfectly adequate for our needs, everything you could want was provided, mini bar, complementary toiletries. The rooms are all very traditional and unique, each with antique furniture and paintings on the walls - so very different to a large anonymous, impersonal hotel. The bathroom was rather small, but the shower is fantastic - so that makes up for it!The only thing that wasn't in the room which I would have liked was Tea &amp; Coffee facilities. It is rather nice to be able to make a drink when you want, rather than have to wait 20 minutes for one to be bought to your room. On one occassion when we ordered a pot of coffee for two, we were bought 2 pots of tea, I haven't drunk tea for about 14 years!A couple of nice touches are the newspaper which is outside your door every morning, the card detailing the weather for the following day and the shoe cleaning service. I'm not entirely sure why the restaurant of a traditional hotel is an Italian - not what you might expect.We would stay there over any other central London hotel any day of the week - the only location downside is that it isn't right in the centre, but then this has it's plus points - it's quiet for one.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
03/11/09,"My wife and I have just returned from this hotel staying two nights under an arrangement with Auctionair. It was our first visit but it wont be our last. We arrived midday on Saturday 31st October. It was slightly chaotic to begin with as our room wasnt quite ready but very soon everything was sorted out whilst we enjoyed sandwiches and a free glass of prosecco. Our room 102 was on the first floor facing out over Dorset Square resplendent in golden trees. It had a huge bed, two large windows suitably double glazed to keep out all but the very noisiest of motor bikes, bedecked with heavy braid curtains. The walls had a black flecked wall paper. The furniture was stressed to give a feel of a Victorian bedroom. But not the bathroom which was very modern, marble walls and washbasin, a bath with shower overhead (you worked the shower with side taps on the bath). The loo took rather a long time to refill but that would be the only criticism. Plenty of towels, flannels, hand towels, shower gels etc. Perfect. Oh yes , and SKY SPORTS 1 and 2....Our arrangement meant that we could dine in the hotel restaurant one evening. The current advertisement states that the restauarnt is English - the Potting Shed. But no more... it ceased trading four months ago. It is now an Italian restaurant and a good one too. Sadly it has yet to make itself known in the neighbourhood owing to restrictions on outside signs. A shame because we had a splendid four course meal , beautifully cooked and presented by very enthusiastic staff, mostly Italian but also a New Zealander. One Italian lass had been in London for around 16 weeks arriving here from Geno not knowing any English. Serena is now almost word perfect !! The meal cost - including the tip - £92. But the arrangement we had through Auctionair meant that the hotel picked up the tab !!The two breakfasts in the same restaurant underground were just about the best we have had in any London hotel. I had smoked salmon and scrambled egg which would have graced the table of Prince Charles (his favourite dish apparantely ), and next morning a full English which has only been equalled by the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong. Again this was included in our prepaid cost.But it was our last eating experience which surprised us the most. After a hard slog around London on Sunday afternoon we returned for English tea in the lounge. Wow ! More heaps of smoked salmon, toast, sandwiches, cakes, custard buns, fresh strawberries, muffin, butter, jam. The table was groaning and we had so much that there was no need to dine out that evening !So reader, if you are thinking of a true British stay then try here. One look at the visitors book will satisfy your questions. The only small downside is that the hotel is just outside the normal tourist area but a short walk will take you to Baker Street - yes Sherlock Holmes Museum nearby - fascinating, from where you can take buses 159 and 453 down to Pioccadilly and Trafalgar Square.We shall be back - thanks to Auctionair !Tony and Hilary IrelandCheltenhamAstrotravel",TripAdvisor,Dorset
22/10/09,"My husband and I stayed in the Dorset Square and it was just lovely!! I would recommend to anyone. It is in a great location, and the staff where very helpful. What a great hotel...will be sure to stay again when visiting London!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
20/10/09,"We were looking forward to our 1-night stay having booked through air-miles. We checked in and were informed that we were getting an upgrade to a room with a 4-poster bed. Great ! But, we were taken aback when we found that the room was in the basement, also the wash basin was cracked and the television was not connected.  The main problem occurred in the restaurant in the morning when we tried to order breakfast. We kept asking each of the waitresses for tea and breakfast but they were unable to give us anything. One who spoke English said that this was because the water heater was broken and that they had to boil water in a kettle and that they had to do the bedroom orders first. There were several angry people in the restaurant as they also couldn't get breakfast. We saw the duty manager who apologised and told us that there were staff problems and equipment failure but he made no effort to get us breakfast . I left comments to this effect at the hotel and wrote to them when I got home but no reply. I contacted air-miles in September and after a months wait we were offered £20 compensation which we felt was derisory. Jennifer and Eddie",TripAdvisor,Dorset
15/10/09,"We stayed here for 4 nights in September. We were happy with every aspect of this hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable.The hotel is across the street from a gated park and the area is peaceful and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel is close to Marlebone and Baker St. tubes, though we used Marlebone more b/c it is a nicer tube station. The hotel restaurant looked very nice although we never had a chance to eat there. The only possible negative thing I could say about Dorset Square was that the hotel staff didn't have many suggestions when it came to sightseeing in or around London. Other than that, it was perfect.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
14/10/09,"Everything about the Dorset Square Hotel was fantastic. The room was beautiful and comfortable with a view over Dorset Square. The staff was helpful. I am especially pleased because I wanted to stay in a different part of London than I normally have, and the Dorset Square Hotel and the neighborhood fit the bill in every respect. I highly recommend it.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
28/09/09,"We absolutely enjoyed this hotel, it was very quaint and &quot;english&quot;. The service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to help us with what ever we needed. For example, we booked on Expedia and had requested a king room and we were given a double. The staff moved us to a king room after a phone call. The bathroom was very nice, extremely clean. The room was not large by North American standards but still roomy enough. My only complaint was the lack of anything to watch on TV, there were very few channels to choose from (but we didn't come to London to watch TV). The hotel is ideally located only a few blocks from the Marylebone Tube Station and a five minute walk from the Baker Street Tube Station. We would definately stay here again!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
19/09/09,"My Husband and I are well travelled and are from Toronto. We stayed at The Dorest Square Hotel for 2 nights in September and had a fantastic time. It was our first trip to London, and we were quite impressed with the friendly staff that awaited our arrival.The hotel Lobby has beautiful old charm ambience, and after travelling a few hours by train, it was fantastic to have fresh fruit awaiting our arrival in the hotel lobby. Complementary fruit for its guests was a very nice touch, which my Husband enjoyed every morning.Rooms are very clean and quiet, fresh towels, and a complementary news paper every morning was also a nice touch. Close to many restaurants and pubs by foot. We strongly recommend walking to Fish Works the best Fish n Chips in London. Also, its a must to purchase day tickets for &quot;The Original Tour London Sightseeing&quot; busses. For 20 GBP each you can hop on and off these busses as many times as you with in a 24 hour span and see all the major attractions without having to take regular transit or taxiesI rate this boutique hotel 4.5 out of 5 and would most definitely return again in the future.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
13/09/09,"I lived this hotel. The room was beautiful, with a view of Dorset Square. The location was perfect. Two short blocks from the Marylebone Tube. The staff was friendly and helpful, as was the staff in their restaurant. I would definitely stay here again!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
13/09/09,"Second time I have stayed at this great little hotel in central London. This time on business with important Italian business partner. The unique English styling and individuality was a great hit. Customer service was as fantastic as last time, and the new Italian resturant downstairs provided very high quality food at good value for money (Italian partner also confirmed this!)I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a convienient central location, but also wishes to stay in a real top class environment, rather than a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; hotel chain.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
11/08/09,"This was the first stop on a vacation to London, Paris, Rome, and Sorrento with my mother. It was by far the best hotel of our trip. The charming rooms were beautifully decorated and the proximity to the Tube was great--easy walk to Baker Street and Marylebone stations. Although we weren't close enough to walk to any of the main tourist attractions, we found it nice to get away from those areas at the end of the day. Close to little grocery store and convenience store for picking up cheap drinks/snacks. The staff were absolutely superb. It was our first time to London and we had a lot of questions, but they were always happy to point us in the right direction. I started to list individual names, but in all honesty, everyone who works there deserves a big thank you. We had a few little glitches (safe wouldn't open and it had our stuff inside; the driver they arranged to take us to the theater refused to pick us up after the show; and one day breakfast started too late for us to make our tour). However, in every case, they worked with us to find a solution (giving the safe time to rest; getting us a new ride to/from the theater; providing pasties/juice early). Our only itty-bitty complaints? Expensive wi-fi. The water pressure in the shower was too good! It drenched everything in the bathroom everytime we used it. Breakfast was included in our rate, but we weren't sure which items on the menu were included (some weren't). Oh, and we had trouble with the tv...but we didn't care enough to bother asking for help which I'm sure we would have received. Overall, a wonderful stay!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
25/07/09,"This place was just great! the location was wonderful, not in the middle of the hustle and bustle but very close. great places to eat and an incredible pub around the corner (nice to walk home!!) the staff was just as good as it gets. the room as very large (after visiting 5 countries prior to our stay here, this room was the biggest). very very clean! bed was very comfortable. hotel restaurant was overpriced so we did not eat there. there is paid wifi only and its expensive, go down to a coffeeshop on baker street or internet cafe for ONE pound per hour versus 7 in the hotel. one little coffeshop offers it for free if you spend 3 pound. go to marleybone station it is just great, we used baker street until we realized marleybone was RIGHT THERE! hotel should do just a bit of a touch up on carpet and furnishings in the common areas, would make it more pleasant to sit in the lounge area. staff is top rated, i would stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
15/07/09,"My husband only stayed for one night, in transit after a week in Edinburgh, but we came away with a very favorable impression. The location couldn't be better, near Regent's Park and the restaurants and shops of Marylebone. We asked for a quiet room with a king size bed, and that's what we got. It was charmingly decorated in an old-fashioned style in chintz, but the bed was excellent and the bathroom roomy and completely up-to-date. The restaurant was closed for dinner because it was Sunday, but the staff steered us to an excellent bistro nearby. The public areas are quiet, with books, comfortable chairs, and an honor bar. I would definitely stay at this hotel in the future.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
27/06/09,"Asked to change room, front desk person was not honest about other rooms available. Room was on ground floor, carpet dirty, night tables dusty, bed vibrated and shook every time the trains which ran under the hotel went by, every five minutes until 1 AM and started up again at 5 AM. Spoke to management in morning, received apology and assurances they don't normally operate in this way. According to him, it was an inexperienced new person on duty. Individuals who worked in restaurant very courteous and friendly. I know other's like it, but our stay was a disaster!!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
24/06/09,"We stayed here last minute, not knowing what it would be like. We were not only surprised but amazed at the lengths the employees particularly David, Joanna and Chris, went to to make us feel comfortable and give us any information we needed.The hotel itself is decorated beautifully in classic English style. I have nothing negative to say about the Dorset Square and it's staff. The hotel is great but the staff even better. Highly recommended.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
15/06/09,"Wow, what helpful staff at the front desk. They were always there to lend advice, travel arrangements, food recommendations, reservations, etc. Especially great was Davide whom made me feel as if I were coming home every night late after work ended. The sitting room is a great place to unwind after a long day. The proximity to Regents park was great for runs and next to Marlyebone station - perfect location for a business trip when you are tired of the same old stuff from the boring chain hotels. Wish they had a gym or a gym membership somewhere.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
15/06/09,"staff were more than helpful and even walked a few blocks to chase a cab for us. the hotel greeted us after the long flight from australia and was worth every penny. massive bed, comfy surroundings and a quiet but well located hotel. a double thumbs up.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
12/06/09,"I have stayed at the Dorset Square several times over a span of 20 years. The rooms are well decorated and appointed, and the bathrooms are well supplied and comfortable to use. There was ample storage space for clothes. On my last visit I was welcomed as a return guest and upgraded to adjoining rooms (there were 4 of us) on the top floor. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, and had answers to any questions quickly at hand. We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and once for an afternoon snack and drink, and we also enjoyed use of the honesty bar with some fellow travelers we met by chance. It was a bit rainy on our visit and it was helpful to have umbrellas supplied, and the hotel felt cozy in less than ideal weather. I will continue to stay here happily and recommend it to my friends and family.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
06/06/09,The hotel is well located [15 mins walk to Lords Cricket Ground and 2 tube stations] and opposite a small park .Although close to Marlebone Road and Baker St it was quiet.The rooms clean and well appointed although standard rooms were a tad small for all the luggage we had.The staff are the Hotels biggest asset very friendly and helpful. They allowed us a no charge late check out and after we checked out we sat around in their lounge for a couple of hours waiting for our shuttle bus they offered tea and coffee and came in for a chat to see if we were OK. Their restaurant for dinner and breakfast couldn't be faulted.The only downside was the minibar which was ineffective at keeping things cold .,TripAdvisor,Dorset
20/05/09,"My wife and I have stayed at the Dorset Square ten times since 2001. It is an ideal location for us--close to Regent's Park and with excellent Tube connections from Baker Street. More important it is quite,beautifully maintained and with a friendly,well-trained staff who always respond to requests cheerfully and helpfully. We have travelled widely and never found a better hotel--and seldom found any as good..",TripAdvisor,Dorset
18/05/09,"We stayed in this hotel for three days in May. It is a fabulous location, across from the park and within a block or so of two underground stations. The staff is fabulous, and went the extra mile for us several times. The hotel is clean and comfortable. While a little small, the rooms are comfortable, have hi-speed internet service available, and excellent bathrooms with ultra modern fixtures and finishes and large tubs. We would definately stay there again and recommend it to our friends.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
09/05/09,"You did indeed exceed our expectations!

Five stars all around. Well be back!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
05/05/09,"We had an excellent six-day stay. The room was small but more than adequate. The bathroom was large and modern. Breakfasts were great, and the restaurant also offered excellent other meals.

04/05/09,"good service and very friendly helpfull staff, room was nice but small ,we had no desk or table so doing your hair or makeup was a problem. there was no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which was the thing i least liked about the hotel , and because of this i would not go back which is a shame . they need to put a price list in the room for room service",TripAdvisor,Dorset

27/04/09,"Just back from 2 nights at the Dorset Square. Found it to be perfectly located in Marleybone, near to Baker St tube station and within walking distance of Regents Park and Camden. The staff were really helpful and very friendly, and the room we got (having asked specifically for one at the front of the hotel) was lovely - not huge but plenty big enough for the two of us. Didn't get to use the restaurant or bar in the evenings as there was a wedding on both nights, but we had a drink in the (very pricey) 'honesty bar' in the drawing room. Would definitely return to this hotel, and would happily recommend it to anyone.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

20/04/09,"I recently spent a weekend with my partner at the Dorset Square and can only strongly recommend it to anyone - no matter if for business or pleasure! The staff is very friendly, the rooms are designed with high quality interior and very clean! We also went to the Restaurant for a great evening meal (fantastic fish and wine) and had a great breakfast the next morning! Go for the Italian Breakfast, something a bit differnt to the usual Full English, the sausages are great but ask one of the friendly staff to swap the Pancetta with the English Bacon - the perfect mix! Even the tea was great - loose leaf tea - which is very important to me! The location also ticks all boxes - a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street. Overall a great stay!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
16/04/09,"We would stay here again , the hotel is really attractive and well decorated. Charming staff - helpful but low key and restful in atmosphere. Our superior room was very well appointed with a view of the square. Very well placed to get to most places. The breakfast was in&quot; The Potting Shed &quot; restauraunt which was charming and it was a really good breakfast - I mention this as I notice that after criticism the manager posted a note on this site to say they had overhauled the breakfasts -and they have done a good job!!",TripAdvisor,Dorset

13/03/09,"I stayed here for one night with my wife. The location is excellent: close to Marylebone station and Baker Street tube, and MArylebone road has loads of taxis, so getting around is easy. there is an NCP car park 100m away although it is pricey. The hotel is situated outside the Congestion Charge zone so is useful if you are coming into London by car.It is handy for Lord's Cricket Ground, Regent's Park London Zoo and Madame Tussaud's.Service is good with staff keen to help. Rooms are comfortable, not large but large enough. we were initally given room 14, right by reeption and the lift with a window opening onto the central service shaft; there was a loud fan running almost all the time which may distrub ome; we asked to be relocated and the staff were happy to move us to the 4th floor, facing the street but no intrusive noise; nice view across the square. The bed was comfy and the shower excellent: hot and powerful. Complementary bottle water by the bed, satellite TV and internet access but no kettle.The main disappointment was breakfast. we paid £12 for a continental style buffet. UNfortunately the food was poor, dried out croissants/pastries and dried out cheeses and meat. The tea and coffe good but service slow and somnolent. For example, our orange juice arrived after the toast and coffee. No containers for jam/honey which had to be smeared on the side of one's plate to bring it from the buffet. On the plus side, our table was wobbly, noticed by a waiteress and sorted without us having to mention it.In summary, the hotel is comfortablegood location, helpful staff but let down by breakfast. In retrospect I should have had breakfast in a nearby cafe.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

18/02/09,"A little gem to stay at when in London! Everything is very personal. . Rooms feel like you are staying in a guest room of a friend's comfy home. Lovely colors, art work and a decorator's touch of pleasing fabrics and finishings. I have returned several times enjoyed my stay this time because of the room. It was bright, light and very comfortable. (It was an upgrade and I appreciate that very much!) And a sky light in the bathroom....PRICELESS! I love the hotel location, (a 5 minute walk from the Baker Street tube, a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street) the convenience of public transportation. (you can get a bus to Stansted and Luton airport right at the corner) Very good value! I will return again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

23/01/09,This hotel was really superb - the bar and food was my favourite and the name 'the potting shed' i thought really suited the hotel.

22/01/09,"I have stayed at the Dorset Hotel twice in the last 4 months. The staff is always gracious and welcoming. The bedrooms are charming and the bathrooms are granite with heated towel racks. My room was always carefully cleaned and the housekeeping staff left me a note each day about the weather forecast. The Baker Street and Marylebone tube stations are both a few blocks away and provide east access to the rest of London. Rooms are typically small for London, but so well appointed that the size seems insignificant. I always look forward to seeing a new room, since they are all different. So far, I have not been disappointed.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
20/01/09,"This year I had the pleasure of spending the second weekend of January at Dorset Square. Being set in a charming Regency square the hotels façade is quintessentially English as is the interiors décor. Theres a mixture of period features, classic pieces and antique furniture which provide for a warm, homely feel and make a refreshing change from the generic appearance typified by larger establishments. In keeping with the hotels style the staff have a friendly, personable manner which is both welcoming and attentive. Due to the wealth of restaurants in the West End I didnt eat in the Potting Shed but the breakfast was of the expected calibre, well prepared with ample choice. My visit was purely for leisure (site seeing, sales shopping and relaxation) and the hotel is well placed to satisfy all three within easy walking distance. As with any good host Dorset Square was more than accommodating and my stay was comfortable, satisfying and trouble free. All in all a welcome antidote to the many soulless alternatives, I look forward to my next visit.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
17/01/09,"I stayed with my girlfriend at Dorset Square Hotel for the first time on New Years Eve, and on arrival we were greeted and felt welcomed by the Reception Team.

For anyone wanting a change, I would definitely recommend Dorset Square Hotel before any other.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
18/12/08,"Stayed at many hotels in the Small Luxury Hotels 'Club' and this doesn't dissapoint. I've stayed in some of the best hotels in London (Claridges, Langham tec.) and though this bijou hotel perhaps can't match some of these for glitz, it more than equals them for service. [Nick the new manager at the Dorset is the perfect host!].The Hotel itself is beautifully decorated with real character and has some great touches [an 'antique' Roberts Radio in my bedroom - 302]. Rather than staying in a more expensive generic mega-chain hotel (which I did on the Grosvenor square last friday) try this little taste of England in a quieter, but central, area of town.Thoroughly recommended.

13/09/08,"My stay in late July, at the Dorset Square Hotel in London was beyond all my expectations. It was my first stay at a 4* Hotel, but I wanted to explore other areas of London after years of staying at the Park Lane Icons. This Hotel was completely on the mark for those who want to experience London, not just the hotel. My Regency Room had a fabulous view of Dorset Square, large windows that opened to let in the afternoon breeze, comfortable bed, well designed bathroom, and a cosy seating area. I spent 2 weeks there with my daughter and 18 month old grandchild with no regrets about room size.The staff are friendly and attentive. The reception area was warm and inviting with fresh apples set on the dark wood reception desk,complimentary umbrellas for the times you forget to bring one from the room, and all the ambiance of an English Townhouse. Walking distance to Marylebone High Street.The rooms were kept immaculately clean, the carpets in good condition, the turn down service, complimentary bottled water each night and weather forcast card all very much appreciated.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
20/05/08,"We stayed for 2 nights last weekend (we were at Lords for the 3rd day of the test) and what a lovely hotel. I'd read some of the more negative reviews on this site and considering what we were paying (£170 per night) I was slightly worried. I needn't have been. The hotel was great, the location was great and the staff very friendly. Our room was delighful and overlooked the square. I'm a light sleeper but neither the traffic noise (could hardly hear it) or the tube (again... could hardly hear it) caused me a problem.I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family and hope to stay there again soon.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
09/02/08,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Dorset Square for one night midweek in February, It's an inconspicous but quite attractive building, close to Marylebone Station and within 20 minutes walk of Oxford Street (shopping!), so it's a convenient location. I booked it through Laterooms for £150, which isn't all that much for a London hotel. Not cheap either, mind...Initial impressions were good - what a nice change to see the staff of a London hotel actually smile at you! Reception is well-appointed, although I bet when several people are trying to check in it must be a nightmare trying to fit people in - there's no real foyer to speak of.Check-in was fine and we went up to our room. Now, I've stayed in some small rooms, but I didn't think it would be quite so small! If it weren't for the zip-and-link bed I'd have sworn it were a single room. (Room 105, by the way). Still, although it was a small room, it was both clean, nicely furnished and well decorated, particularly the bathroom. No complaints about the standard of the room then (size nonwithstanding), and the huge window gave plenty of light. No, it's not quiet, but it's the middle of London - if you want quiet then stay elsewhere!As for quiet, I was surprised to clearly hear the Underground running beneath us when in bed, and the acoustics of the bathroom really amplified the sound. Don't get me wrong, the windows weren't rattling or anything, but light sleepers might be disturbed. Note that the Underground stops running around 12.30am though, so it wouldn't keep you awake all night.We didn't have dinner at the hotel, but we did go down for a drink (1 drink is complimentary by the way, which is a nice touch I'd like to see in more of the upmarket hotels). £32.50 for three drinks was a bit steep even for London, and given that the bar and restaurant aren't really very luxurious or well-stocked. I suppose most of the clientele get to charge it to expenses! Both restaurant and bar are underneath the hotel, which makes it feel like you're about two feet above the trains running beneath the floor! I personally found this an amusing, slighty charming accidental feature, but it might bother others. I'd advise the management to spend a little time on staff training in the bar, as we were needlessly ignored for several minutes despite being spotted, then the drinks were poured in the wrong measures, and I had to tell the barmaid/waitress how to make my drink anyway. We felt a little uncomfortable, as though we were an inconvenience, depite the place being near-empty.Check-out was fine and the hotel held our bags until the evening while we went out for the day.Overall I'd say that this is a nice hotel, better than some other 4* places I've stayed in London. It's really good that it has a less corporate-like atmosphere, and finding London hotel staff that actually smile at you is a blessing. It seems like such a minor point, but it makes you feel like a GUEST rather than customer No. 3657 that day. I was going to give Dorset Square 3 out of 5, but I think it's worth a little more because of the well-appointed public areas and room, plus friendly staff, so I'll give it 4, but do be aware that it's small if you book a standard room, and has noise from the Underground.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
05/12/07,"I have been following these review threads with great interest as our family was slated to stay here for five nights over Thanksgiving. I was almost sick with anticipation when we entered our room. Would it be the smallest room ever encountered? Loud? Worn carpeting? Divine? Full of antiques and charm? Luckily for us, our experience was much more the latter than the former. We booked two rooms and had our junior year abroad daughter in for one night as well. So we have experience in three rooms. By far the best and most charming was room 101. I would highly recommend this room It was QUIET. Not on the street, quite roomy with enough room for two easy chairs and a desk (no, not huge but very comfortable) very luxurious bathroom (though I will say anyone with ambulatory issues might have difficulty getting in and out of the shower) again the bathroom was NOT huge. Very pretty with cheerful decorating and tons of charm. Room 100 was MUCH smaller though cozy enough for two. Again quiet, no traffic. Smaller bathroom too. The twin my daughter got was again very small but COMPLETELY charming. One twin, one chair and desk, small bathroom over looking the park but probably the coziest spot I have ever seen. My poor over roommated daughter nested in there like it was her job. She has very happy memories of that room. Not sure the # but it was catty corner to room 101. Didn't do the breakfast package, don't bother. There are two or three very decent coffee/tea pastries spots less than a half block away as well as a small fruit stand and decent grocery store. Makes it feel like you actually live there which is what I loved. No sterile, isolated hotel feeling here. Happy to clarify for anyone. I will check back.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
19/10/07,"2 parts to this review, good and badThe GOODGood location, easy to get to the tube. Local restaurants for grabbing a sandwich fast. The in hotel restaurant books out for dinner, so make reservations early, or go somewhere more fun! The room was delightful, very cosy, very tiny, but adorably cute and livable, and charming with fine materials, marble, wood, good quality cloth furnishings, very well decorated, a writing desk. The staff is helpful and polite. The manager was competent and friendly. I am bringing my family back to enjoy this hotel. I loved that my room looked out over a London street because it is a view I do not get in San Diego. A park, while nice, is not as interesting to me. There was no noise problem, because of double paned windows and climate control in the room. The food is very good. The sitting area off the reception is inviting, relaxed and it made me feel English. And they sent me a lovely bottle of wine for a foul-up. I wish I had taken a photo of the bathroom, the room was small, but the bathroom was roomy with marble and granite. The BadI booked this hotel via LastMinute.com and paid for it in full 3 weeks in advance. I had an early train that day from the North and arrived in London at 7:30 am. So I went to the hotel to drop off my luggage. When I arrived I was told, very politely, that they did not have a room for me for that night. I had to call LastMinute, who, an hour later, solved the problem, but I did not get the double room I had paid for, but I did receive a refund for the difference. And I was fine with the room I did get. However, initially, they were going to ship me to another hotel until I stood my ground.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
17/10/07,"I booked through Hotel.com and paid £240 for a Superior room only to find out at check-in the rate was £180.00 and the hotel put this rate on the room card - not a good start. So, onward to the room and make a note of the number it is 11. You cannot miss it - it is right opposite Reception. The bed is big and the sheets are clean, the view is awful, the floor boards in the room directly above squeek, the vibrations from the underground are very evident, the shower is badly designed - bending round a screen and get drenched by the water and needless to say the location of the room adjacent to Reception is very noisy &amp; intrusive. Definitely would not return - ever, there are better choices in London.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
30/07/07,"Our friends have recommended the Dorset Square Hotel to us as we were going on a romantic getaway to London. Since the arrival, we can not fault anything, the entire staffs was friendly, helpful and very professional, they knew everything about the area, recommended to us excellent plays and restaurants in nearby Marylebone village. The room was outstanding; it was facing the square, with a beautiful traditional English deco and immaculately clean. We loved the weather cards on the turndown and friendly smiles of the housekeeping staff. After our 3 nights stay at the Dorset we didnt want to leave. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants the central location, tasteful, good value-for-money and beautiful rooms and knowledgeable and always ready to help staff. Well done Dorset Square!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
07/07/07,"I booked for 3 nights, but actually couldn't stand. The room was incredibly small and moreworse noisy. I can't understand why some people have highly evaluated this hotel. There was no merit to stay. I strongly recommend you not to choose this hotel.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
05/07/07,"I read a review of the Dorset Square - now realize that the word &quot;intimate&quot; is a code word for small and cramped. That review was 2 years old and since then the price has gone up and the service down. There was 1 rude, young Indian man to check you in and a Serbian bellman who had difficulty communicating just to get the bags to the room. The bellman was friendly, but the reception man was not. He totally refused to let us see the room before checking in. Also, i am telling you that the carpeting not only is shot, but it is badly stained. In many places, it was disgusting. The room smelled of mildew. It was hot and the a/c did not cool it down quickly. It was so small, we couldn't store the luggage and walk around the bed. The bathroom window faced a busy street where people congregated. The plaster was peeling in several places. This is in addition to the neighborhood being out of the way and somewhat iffy. Maybe it is a 3 star, but given the price and how it was described, I had assumed it was a 4 star, whatever that really means. We tried to accept the room for a half hour or so, then called the Goring and left. We were charged for the night, which does bother us. However, the Goring was pleasant and we ended the trip on a high note. Honestly, the Dorset Square is a dump. It needs to be refurbished and better staffed before being recommended again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
04/07/07,"Just wanted to say how much we loved the Dorset Square. Perfect location for all the things we wished to see and do. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was facing the beautifull little square and we really liked the atmosphere in the hotel, furnished with the antiques, yet very clean and airy. We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London and we will return as well.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
28/06/07,"We stayed at the Dorset Square Hotel for a bit of a higher price during the Wimbledon season during the summer of 2007. First greeted by the concierge-receptionest with a loss of a credit card, we took the elevator to the fourth foloor and entered the tiniest room either of had yet to see. The bathroom oversized the room and made you feel closterphobic by the walls surrounding, and immediately called down to go &quot;check out&quot; the other rooms, because neither could live in this room or $500 dollars a night. Eventually, we moved across the hall (room 406) to a slightly bigger rom with a beautiul veiw of the park. Entering the following days, the room stayed cool with a dream-like bed and leisure bathroom, but, the bathroom did not have any plugs for blow drying/straighting hair. The house keeping is extremely kind &amp; caring, and will ask you prefered times to clean your room. Everyone has a beautiful smile on their face. But, upon ordering room service in the morning, we discovered our &quot;free&quot; breakfast was one of the grossest experience of either of our lives. Everytime we ordered room service, they would forget something- from silverware to a whole meal. Finally, the eager tipping slowed down (as did they).You are sleep deprived by the cars zooming by (and can see the sunrise through the curtains at exactly 4 A.M.) and can hear the man next door pacing all night and chatting on the phone to his wife (acusing him of an affair) like he is sitting in your room. The location is fair, with a short walk to Oxford St., the most amazig shopping experience you will have. There are plenty of wonderful people surrounding by.Our central phone (one by bed &amp; bathroom) was broken, and th conciegre has not (on the last night of our one week stay) taken the time to fix it. Overall, the time had was absolutely phenomenal- but I will not suggest this quanit, overpriced hotel to anyone else. For this price, a goodnight sleep is required.Have a wonderful London stay.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
28/06/07,"I have stayed at the Dorset Square Hotel over the past 6 years. Tthe experience has usually been enjoyable. However, this trip they put in a room at the back of the hotel which overlooks a main London road. This morning at 4:30AM the trucks and buses started to come by and being a somewhat light sleeper I could not sleep anymore. This morning I asked them to shift rooms to the front of the hotel. The desk clerk said &quot;no problem&quot; but when I returned after dinner I am in the same room. I expect another early morning tomorrow when the trucks begin to roll by.I recommend you do not stay at this hotel. It does have some English charm, but they do not seem to care sufficiently about their paying guests. I am shocked by the treatment--they had numerous people checking out today and they could have switched rooms for me.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
13/06/07,"I booked after reviewing the feedback here. I was looking for a relatively cheap but decent hotel for 1 night in between meetings. I got a reasonable rate from [--]. It is v convenient for Marylebone. The welcome at reception was friendly and professional. I stayed in 401, and I didn't want to go out to my meeting! The room was quite small but very light and airy. The bathroom had a skylight which was nice. There was a bit of road noise, but I was so tired it didn't bother me. I didn't eat there but the menu and room service looked OK. They do a nice thing which is ordering your breakfast to go, and you pick it up at reception when you leave for the day - OK you won't get a full English, but you can get anything else from an apple and some water to a bacon butty and tea!Highly recommended!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
21/05/07,"We stayed at The Dorset Square when they were doing a special promotion for their restaurant The Potting Shed.The hotel was very sweet and we had a lovely room overlooking the square. The decor was quite English chintzy which although not to my taste, was done very well and looked very stylish. They had some nice touches like an umbrella you could borrow (which we did!) and they came to turn down your bed leaving you with a weather report for the next day. Bed abd room were all super clean and comrortable with a nice marble bathroom and power shower.We ate in the restaurant and the food really was exceptional and very reasonable. My only complaint would be that it was SO QUIET, despite it being almost full of guests. We were quite a loud party of 4 and I felt that we were constantly saying Sshhh to each other so as not to offend the other diners. They really need to add some music or add something to stop noise reverberating off every wall. Really fautless food and service but the atmosphere isn't quite right in the restaurant yet.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
19/04/07,"The hotel accommodations are modest and rooms need serious updating. The carpet in our room was completely worn and the bed spread had dark stains across it. The staff is neither knowledgeable nor helpful and as a result, the hotel suffers. Overall, we were very disappointed and would not stay at the Dorset again. It's expensive and not worth the cost. The restaurant is also modest and food was fair.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
15/04/07,"We have just stayed 3 nights at the Dorset Square - and the experience - well:1) London in general is VERY expensive for hotels so I guess any Price/Quality ration can't really be compared. However for our rate (130£ pr night) it was &quot;OK&quot;2) Noise levels: You can hear some form of &quot;train&quot; (underground ?) - so it is not for the light sleeper3) Location is fine (close to BondSt station, within (long) walking distance of the shopping etc.) So all in all: OK experience - however I did not have the special &quot;luxery feel&quot; - it was OK, comfortable and painless in the middle of London. Fine - and I may consider staying here again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
08/02/07,"Nice looking hotel with kerb appeal, in a safe area.Booked with last minute a standard dble was the same price as a deluxe,which is what we booked.Reception staff pleasant &amp; helpful on arrivalVery nice room,compact but it's pointless having a 'Vegas suite' if you're not living in it !Well decorated with a soft bed and a very smart bathroom.Room had; hairdryer,robes,minibar/fridge, safe &amp; even an umbrella!Only thing missing was a kettle, but this was rustled up in minutes by the very helpful staff.This hotel is minutes from Baker street tube so access to most of London from 3/4 different tube lines is available.There is also a Tesco express down the way for T.bags &amp; milk !!The only negative was that the room was too hot.I like a cool bedroom at night and despite turning the ac down to 16 it was still too hot.Would recommend and use again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
06/01/07,"After traveling in Europe and spending quite a bit of money for rooms we were pleasantly surprised at the value at this hotel. The rate was inclusive of taxes and breakfast and it was worth the price. The breakfast was excellent. We had many choices and the staff was quite pleasant even though they were all quite new and inexperienced at the front desk. They helped to get us good seats to some shows and tried to recommend restaurants although they are inexperienced at this. The room was small, but very nicely done with antiques and period furnishings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was well equipped. We loved sleeping there. It was quiet and comfortable. Only one problem -- they need to replace the carpeting in the hallways. They are old and smelly. Not the rooms though. It was very clean. The restaurant is good and the prices are fair for a hotel in London. London is so expensive that I actually found this hotel to be a real bargain. I also liked the Marlybone location -- easy to get around the city from here.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
08/10/06,"We stayed at the Dorset Square in September 2006 and enjoyed the stay. First of all if you are expecting a North American style hotel room then look someplace different as that is not this hotel. The Hotel is older but in great shape and the rooms are very small but very nice (clean, good bed, hot shower). The location is what you are paying for as it is walking distance to major attractions, subway stops, restaurants and more. At night we did not hear a sound and we are both light sleeper, to be in London and feel removed from it all was great. It is about a 20 min walk to the major part of Oxford Street and lots of great shops and restaurants. The staff was mainly French and fairly helpful depending on what was asked. They had no problem getting us Theater Tickets but trying to get a good restaurant recommendation out of them was hard to do. Around the corner was a good pub Alstop Arms and just down the street was a great Indian Restaurant (best curry I have had in years). Good hotel but again the rooms very small! For the price good value.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
09/09/06,"My room was next to some machine on the roof so forget about a good night's sleep.Buffet breakfast (£12.50 +£1.50 'service') was cereals, fruit , ham (1 sort), cheese (1 sort), bite-sized pastries, er... thats's it.Night porter offered alarm call, I asked for 7.30, good job I was awake already (see first point)",TripAdvisor,Dorset
28/07/06,"My fiancé and I stayed at the Dorset Square for one night as part of our engagement celebration. The setting is perfect; five mins walk from Marylebone and very close to lots of good restaurants. For tourists, you are pretty much in central London for all the attractions.It is worth noting that this is a true boutique Hotel, meaning that personal service and eccentricity override some peoples expectations of large standardised rooms or bland buffet breakfasts. Our room was extraordinary, tiny and beautiful with original French silk period wallpaper and a Victorian bathroom. You have to decide to love its elegance and individuality; if you start to get irritable with the weak shower or the sash window which had a tendency to crash down without warning, youre missing the point.Breakfast was 1st class in the modern Potting Shed downstairs; free range sausages, bacon and hand-picked duck eggs are not all that common in London, and through the door gap to the kitchen I caught a glimpse of our waiter squeezing blood-oranges for my juice. Now that is fresh!Service was understated but not rude, and they went out of their way to help; we returned with my entire family at midnight from our meal and the concierge on the front desk brought us steaming hot pots of tea and hot chocolate as we sat in the study. He even included a small plate of handmade biscuits. All this at midnight. We were very impressed.It failed only in the bed department (a fondness for eccentricity does not, in my mind, run to how well I sleep!). A tiny double bed, with a mattress built around the same time as the hotel. Pillows were ok, but not up to the rest of the Hotels standard. Thus 4* rather than 5.All in all an extremely memorable stay.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
20/06/06,"I stayed at the Dorset in Feb. with my new husband for the first half of our honeymoon. It was a totally enjoyable stay. The room we stayed on was on the second floor. It was tastefully decorated with a nice size closet, small fridge, and desk. The bathroom was georgeous. A strong shower with an extra deep tub. Upon arrival, the kind bell hop carried our heavy luggage up to our room for us. The concierge was very helpful and accomodating. They arranged and/or assisted us with all the tours and excursions we went on. Each night we returned to a turned down bed with large bottles of water waiting for us. The room was small, but I hear its true of most European hotel rooms. Yes, the TV was small, but when I am on vacation TV is not a major issue. The hotel was close to 2 tube stops so travel was insanely easy. I would definitely recommend the Dorset to anyone looking for a quaint British hotel with lots of charm and hospitality. If you are looking for a hotel with all of decadent American amenities, this may not be the place for you.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

In this 4 stars hotel and for euros 275, I spent one of my worse night ever (probably slept 3 hours in total)Walls are so thin that you can hear everything surrounding the room and everytime someone walks by you have the impression that he is in your room, 1 inch space under the entry door, bathroom ridiculously small, AC so noisy that you must turn it off, 1 star hotel like TV with no cable, windows not isolated while heavy traffic outside.

10/01/06,"After countless hours searching for a hotel in London for our family of 4, we hit the jackpot. We spent 4 days/nights in London with our 3.5 year old and our 20 month old, mid-November of 2005. It seemed like an impossible task to find a hotel to house the 4 of us, that got consistently good reviews, that had decent sized rooms, good location to the tube, and that wouldn't break the bank. FINALLY, I stumbled acrossed a special that the Dorset Square was having -look at slh. They have a weekend special for Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun nights for 100 pounds/night. That price includes VAT and breakfast (for our whole family). The hotel was kind enough to give us the same rate even though we stayed through Mon night. About the hotel. This was truly a luxury hotel. The staff was phenominal. Immediatley when we got there the doorman was outside unloading our heavily loaded down taxi, and helping after the kids. Reception was very nice and helpful. Our room was gorgeous. While we didn't actually have a room that slept all of us in beds, they allowed us to make a bed on the floor for our daughter, and they provided us a portable crib for our son free of charge. We had a gorgeous king-sized bed (which worked out great since that's where our daughter ended up sleeping - with us). The room was good-sized I'm assuming for London standards. We were not crowded at all, even with the port-a-crib. The hotel stored some of our luggage for us in another room (that we didn't need until our next destination). The room was very clean, and had nice touches. Bathrobes, nice towels (&amp; washcloths), shampoos, soaps, etc. They even gave complimentarty bottled waters every day. The breakfast is served down in the Potting Shed Restaurant downstairs. There was a good selection of food. We were a little confused with what we were allowed to order since our breakfast was included. We got different answers from different people working. I thought for sure we were going to get a bill since we apparently ordered more than what was included - but we didn't. Once, my husband went down to get the rest of us breakfast as we had slept in late (time change). The people at the restaurant said they would bring it up to us. They served it beautifully room-service style. I thought we would get a bill for that, but we didn't. Another time my husband went to grab us food we could eat on the tube as we were running late. Again they said they would pack us a breakfast to go. Later that day I read a sign hanging on our door knob inside our room that had prices for boxed breakfasts (outrageous prices! - like it would have been a $50 breakfast for everything they gave us). And still they did not charge us for them. The tube is only 2 blocks away - and it is a pretty direct station. There is an internet cafe a block and a half away. There is a little market just a block away where you can buy a few groceries. There is a small fridge in the room stocked with over-priced items. We took those out and filled it with our own snacks and drinks. We just loved this hotel. I would definitely stay there again, and definitely recommend it to anyone I know. Hope this review helps!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
30/10/05,"Stayed for 1 night while attending a wedding London. Fantastic from start to finish. Needed ideally to book in early which was easily arranged for us. Room ideal for us and bathroom spotless with very powerful shower. Reception staff and concierge could not have been more helpful, especially concierge who when struggling to hail a taxi for us ran to the Station on our behalf!! We did have an excellent deal which appeared to be less than half of normal rates, which included a superb full english breakfast in The Potting Shed restaurant attached. We did not have dinner but if breakfast was anything to go by would not think twice about eating there. Another couple of small details which enhanced our stay was the bottles of mineral water left at turn down and complimentary Sunday paper. Our only minor quibble was the cost of our room service sandwiches which we felt were a tad pricey. Location was also ideal, close to Marylebone and we felt safe even returning at 0130 hrs.Would definitely go back!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
03/10/05,A friend and I booked a twin room at the Dorset only to be given single rooms when we arrived which only cost us £60.00 each with breakfast included - the hotel was really lovely and cosy and close to everything - we were going to Live8 at Hyde Park which we walked to - when we arrived back very late they brought us tea and biscuits at no further cost - a lovely hotel highly recommended. Lovely staff and lovely cosy rooms - spotlessly clean.,TripAdvisor,Dorset

We simply cannot fault anything... the staff were courteous, helpful and attentive. The room was decorated beautifully and was spotlessly clean. The food was delicious. The hotel is situated in the heart of London and after a hard days shopping and sight seeing it was a welcome relief to arrive back to such luxury.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
05/07/05,"My husband and I stayed here in late June 2005, and found the location fantastic. You are close to Marylebone station, Baker Street station and are within walking distance to Oxford Street and Regents Park. We were wowed when we first came in as it was so quaint, our room wasn't ready but we waited in the reading room which was very cute. Staff were great. We got a room on the 3rd floor - it was neat but so, so small. For the two of us with a trolley bag each, there was hardly any space to move. The double bed was small and was full of pillows... the only place we had to chuck two of the large pillows were on the floor against the main door, in order to go to sleep. Although we were right on Dorset Square, you could hardly hear the traffic which was great. Don't expect to sleep in though in the mornings. The walls are paper thin, and when the cleaning staff start vacuuming the hallways or the next room, you will definitely be woken up.Breakfast is not included in the price (which was a bit on the high side but which probably located the location more than facilities), so we just went to Baker Street for coffee.We bumped into another guest once (hallways are so narrow you have to give way to one another) moving rooms, complaining to us that his air-conditioning wasn't working. As the rooms are so small he said that the heat being generated from the minibar was actually making the room hot!All in all, all right for a couple of days' stay. But we left wondering why it was one of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
09/05/05,"I've been staying at the Dorset Square for over a decade now, this however my first stay in the past five years. The hotel is quintessentially British; don't expect huge rooms or a great bargain, but you'll be charmed with exceptional hospitality, lovely details and a great location - just steps from either Marylebone train station or Baker St tube. One grip though was the price for continental breakfast. Absolutely nothing exceptional and completely average, it cost my wife and I over US$60 since everything else nearby was closed that Sunday. So definitely avoid their Potting Shed restaurant.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

The staff were friendly. My only complaint was the price of the breakfast, which was, like all other London Hotels, very expensive. You can get all-day breakfasts from cafes on Marylebone on the way to the tube station for about £4, so save yourselve £8 and do that.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
26/11/03,"I've stayed in this hotel 3 times in 3 years, and highly recommend it to anyone sick of &quot;cookie cutter&quot; hotel chains. Each room, though small by American standards, is decorated uniquely in English country style. The staff is always kind and accommodating. The location is perfect. I can't wait to go back!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
17/11/03,"Not a great experience. For $365 a night I would have expected something better. Tiny, hot rooms, erratic and sometimes surly service, and not a perfect location. I don't know that I'd suggest if you have this kind of money that you should spend it here - either stay at someplace cheap (where you expect lousy service and mediocre rooms) and spend your money elsewhere, or spend a little more and go for something that has to be better.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
13/06/03,"My wife and I stayed here during the spring of 1998 (so in all fairness it has been a while). We had stayed in 4 different places throughout GB on our 2 week trip and this was our least favorite. It was pretty well located in London, However it was the literally the smallest room for the highest price I've ever paid. The elevator was so slow that we finally just would take the stairs up to our 4TH FLOOR ROOM. All in all, the room was clean and not a terrible place, but I wouldn't stay there again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
14/09/02,"My husband and I stayed at the Dorset Square while honeymooning in London in August 1998 after reading a recommendation in Fodor's. We enjoyed our visit so much that we returned in April 2000. The Dorset Square is a lovely small hotel with a staff of friendly, efficient concierges, all of whom consistently went out of their way to make our visits to London enjoyable. The charming decor is reminiscent of a well-appointed country house, and style exudes throughout. The hotel's restaurant, The Potting Shed, serves a delicious full English breakfast which should not be missed before heading out for a day of meetings or sight-seeing. Conveniently located near the Baker Street tube stop and the beautiful Regent's Park, the Dorset Square Hotel is ideal for anyone looking for an affordable luxury hotel.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
03/07/02,"I have not been to the Dorset Square in a few years but used to stay there all of the time when I went to London on business trips in the early to late 1990's. It is a wonderful little place. The least expensive rooms are *very* small but the medium priced rooms are fine and the higher priced rooms are absolutely wonderful. Lots of antiques, beautiful fabrics, marble bathrooms, etc. The staff is lovely - they always remembered my name and, because I was a repeat customer, always left a nice box of &quot;welcome back&quot; chocolates in my room upon my arrival. It never felt like a hotel to me but more like a beautiful home where the staff consisted of my eccentric aunts, uncles, and cousins. When I travel, I usually like to find small, elegant hotels in the suburbs right outside the city. This definitely fit the bill: it is not quite in the burbs but it the northern end, right on the border of Regents Park. Very leafy and residential but only a very short tube ride to downtown. Right near the Baker Street tube entrance. I also enjoyed the delicious breakfasts and room service.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
26/03/02,"My husband and I spent 6 nights here in June 2000. We had a lovely, spacious room with a view of the square from which the hotel derives its name. The service was first rate. The staff was very attentive and accommodated all our requests. We thought the location was very convenient: it is about a block away from an Underground station, and just a couple of blocks from Regents Park, which is a great place for leisurely strolls and people watching. I highly recommend it and we will stay there again the next time we are in London.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
14/02/02,"The Dorset Square Hotel is a conveniently located, moderately priced luxury hotel. It is less than three blocks from the Wax museum in London. Across the street is a pleasant, peaceful park named (what else) Dorset Square, which adds to the quiet ambiance. This is despite the proximity of busy streets and tourist attractions.We were there for three nights in April, 2000 and really enjoyed our stay. Their restaurant served an excellent breakfast, and offered both English and European fare. Buses and taxi's were easy to catch, and some great night spots were a short distance away.This hotel has my recommendation.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
04/03/07,Having read reviews we were very pleasantly surprised. The place newly done up and the staff very pleasant . Its very cheap for London but much better than travel lodge etc Just for the record - The lift does go to the breakast room . The doors have the usual double locks so no one is likely to break in and there is an in room safe. The breakfast is continental ie some cornflakes and toast but what more do you expect for the money. The place was spotlessly clean . The staff are not English but this is London No one who works in hotels is English. !! I would recommend to anyone.,TripAdvisor,Belgrave
22/02/07,"I and my niece stayed for several nights at this hotel. We looked for affordable accommodation, but we should have read first the reviews here. It seems all the negative points to be true. It did not seem a secure hotel, with a lot of suspicious people either in the lounge or outside. The staff are entirely of foreign origin, barely understand English. We didnt feel secure and checked out earlier than planned. So trust negative reviews and book another hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
20/02/07,"After reading some of the reviews i was a little bit wary of bokking there. check in was fast and i was shown to my double room by the staff who i found very hepful and willing. i was really impresed and wondered about the validity of the other reviews.There is no restaraunt but as i undrstand there are plans for a restarant and bar which would really make this place really lively. There is a lovely italian right across the road and many other restaurants in the local area.The hotel is across the road from the Oval tube station and close to waterloo.Our double bedroom was spacious, however there was no airconditioning which could get hot in summer. A double room cost 65 pounds and was more than excellent value for money on par with Confort Inn/ holiday inn express. The decor is nice and did not hear any noises in the night or anyone at the door.There is a 24 hour reception which wuld make it ard for any intruders to enter the hotel without purpose. The hotel also has wireles internet access, lcd screens and sky.I highly reccommend this hotel and would not stay anywhere else when visiting this area.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
14/02/07,"We stayed at this hotel in January for a couple of days. It claims there is a lift, but the proprietors have omitted to say that to get to the hotel lounge you have to climb a step of several dozens narrow steps. How one can manage to do this with several suitcases is left to ones imagination. On the other hand the promised breakfast is without any imagination: each day the same staple of rolls and toast. No eggs, no marmalade. Only the packaged cornflakes were of several varieties. Some rusty black crumbs were flouting in the mineral water jug. There never seem to be many guests in there. Hotel charges you at your check-in for your entire stay, which was not stated in our booking. This made bad impression. Staff barely speaks English. Some suspicious types ----- lurking in the lounge. The area of Lambeth where the hostel is located is according to recent stats above average in terms of criminality. Actually we regularly saw tugs assemble not far from the hostel, across the street. We checked out earlier and moved to another hotel in downtown London. This is bad accommodation in insecure area. Better to avoid.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
16/01/07,"Excellent hotel for the price we payed inclusive of continental breakfast. Hotel has been newly refurbished and at the moment there is no restaurant or bar however as i understand from speaking with the helpful and very friendly staff and management there are plans to develop a restaraunt and bar in the near future. I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else and would highly reccomend this hotel as it is excellent value for money.Rooms have LCD Screens, Rooms Safes, En-suite, tea/coffee facilities, International sky channels, wired and wireless internet access.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
28/12/06,"We needed a hotel for one night before catching the Eurostar early the next morning. This was the perfect stay and very close to the Oval Underground (Tube) stop which is only a few stops from Waterloo station for the Eurostar. Don't be worried from the exterior of the hotel - it's not got much curb appeal. It's located next to the Belgrave Hospital. The inside of the hotel was very nice. The front desk staff was friendly and helped us get settled in. The room was smallish but immaculate. All new furniture and fixtures. Very clean! It's a contemporary style and quite lovely. Nice hair dryer and television.Breakfast is included in the hotel price. There was a small continental buffet in the basement. The area of the hotel wasn't really ideal (Clapham), but would be convenient for sights in South London. The hospital noises were slightly distracting and I would suggest getting a room in the back away from the busy street. Anytime we need to catch the Eurostar, we will stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
04/11/06,"This is a fairly new hotel near the Oval Underground station in Lambeth which is in south London. Getting from here to everywhere you might want to go in touristy London is close by via public transportation. It's in a very nondescript modern building, but inside everything looks freshly decorated. The rooms are small, as are most London hotels, but are impeccably clean. Shower pressure is great which is very important! There's wifi or wired internet available for a fee, and limited parking (also for a fee) in the underground secured parking lot. We paid 70 pounds for a twin bed room, including continental breakfast - hard to beat that rate for a decent hotel in London! The staff is quite friendly and helpful.Some minor drawbacks: it's on a very busy road (Clapham Road) so request a room facing the back if street noises bother you. There's no air conditioning, so it could get hot in the summer. Closet space is very limited. And though that shower pressure is great, the shower stalls themselves are so tiny that it's a bit hard to even turn around. All that wouldn't deter us for staying there again though.Note: this is NOT the same as the Belgrave House Hotel, for which there are several (mostly negative) reviews here.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
14/11/09,"I stayed here for only one night luckely. It location is goord just a very short walk from Victoria station. Its cheap and cheap for a reason, as they do not invest anything in the comfort of the guests. The hotel is a maze of corridors and stair cases which are not suitable for anyone with a disability. I would question the safety of the place, as there was at least 1 fire extinguisher missing from its location, the cleaning staff left bags of rubbish and dirty laundry at the top and bottom of stairs (a calim waiting to happen) The rooms are poorly decorated and appear dirty, I felt the need to wash my hands before using any of the light switches as they were caked in grime. The shared toilets and shower facilities were dirty. I could go on, but like the cleaners there.....I can't be bothered. Would I go back? No.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
07/11/09,"I know there are several reviews slagging this place off, but we stayed in a twin room, for £32.50 per night per room for 3 nights in central London, just close to Victoria Coach station and main line station. If you are expecting luxury accomodation for that money go some where else. The outside and reception look nice, but as others have said it is not a true reflection of inside of the public areas and bedrooms, which are very basic. We didnt do breakfast as got allergies etc, so cant comment on that. However there is a microwave and fridge for guests use, and that prooved handy with a Sainsburys just down the road at Victoria Station. If you have ever back packed abroad and stayed in hostel type accomodation, this is what its like. As we we were out for all of the day, this place was purely as a base to sleep, and with clean sheets, and a bed, it served that purpose adequately for £16 each. If you want something a bit more than that, then you are going to have to pay more, or compromise on position and extra costs and time in travelling to central London, its thats simple. For the price and location its hard to beat, just dont set your expectations that high for that price.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
27/10/09,"The exterior and the reception area were lovely but as soon as you go up the stairs the nasty smells hit you along with the dirty carpets, walls etc. The room was small but bareable, the walls were dirty as was the floor. The worst thing about the room was the bed, it was noisy and so old that the springs were coming out and everytime we turned over they dug in. The location was good. Thats about it.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
21/10/09,"We booked triple room en suite for 2 adults ,1 child for 2 nights. I have read negative reviews in this website before I went there but I was optimistic and thougth that I might be get a better room. But after check in I was realise that all negative reviews are correct. Started from very dirty carpet on stairwell. The room was damp and dirty in every ankle,I think I got the room that show in the hotel picture because every position is the same but not that clean. toilet floor very dirty, toilet curtian was mouldy like never clean for a year. bed very filtchy, spring nearly come out, my back was hurt,not comfortable at all. Cabinet and fridge very bad smell when opened. No kattle available, only one cloth hanger, TV remote didn't work. We complainted to receptionist but that guy said that it was very clean in his view point nothing wrong with the room. We asked for refund but he said that we need to write a complaint letter and leave it until manager come in but do not know when he will come. I could not sleep for the whole night because of noisy both from outside and inside of the hotel. I heard foot step and everything that guest in the room above have done. I wanted to scream, my son(6 years old) was cried. We decided to check out next morning and stay in at premier inn instead. Very angry they get my money. PLEASE DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
20/10/09,"Only two pictures on here respresent the hotel. The picture of the outside and the lobby... the bedrooms look nothing like the clean spacious ones in the pictures. The truth is the the bedrooms are filthy. Fitting hnging off the wall and the wash basin in the room hadn't seen a cleaner in weeks. A dirty foot mark on the wall next to the wash basin. I came to London last week for a meeting and decided to travel the day before in order to be fresh for a 1pm meeting. I really wish I had not bothered. The bed was so uncomfortable that it was easier to sleep on the chair and from the moment you step out of the lobby your feet stick to the filthy carpets. The shared bathroom left much to the imagination and as for breakfast.. toast and cereal, but again I did not eat in the breakfast room because the tables and place mats were all coffee/ tea stained. The staff what I did see of them everythiong appeared to be too much trouble for them. I could not honestly recommend this hotel, even though it was cheap it still was not worth the money. however the location was brilliant. I think with a bottle of disinfectant, new carpets, new bedding to replace the old ripped stuf and plenty of staff training this hotel may warrent it's one star!! DON'T SAY YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WARNED!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
09/10/09,"DON'T STAY HERE! Beds were so uncomfortable that I couldn't sleep - the people that worked there was so rude and told me I could only change rooms (mine was so dirty) if I paid for an upgrade!Instead I just went and stayed in my friends room, which to be honest wasn't much better, but at least I wasn't alone in a creepy dirty room.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
29/09/09,"The web page of the hotel looks really nice but the rooms aren´t. we only stayed for 2 nights and were out all day so we only slept there. We didn´t have it comfortable but it was Ok for the price (we only paid 40£/night for a dubble room!).The bad thing was that when I was booking the room and entered my Visa card nr someone (I don´t say it was the hotel) took my card nr! On the Januari statement from the bank I discovered that my card had been used for several high expenses (several bills was on 600 eur!) Fortunately I got everything back from the bank but it was all very stressful and uncomfortable. I don´t use my card on the internet except when I really have to and have not been using my card at all except for that time booking the hotel. I even thought it was strange the whole booking process so maybe a warning bell should have gone on. It didn´t work at first so I called the hotel and asked about the booking. The guy was quite rude and said that everything should be ok. I tried again and that time it worked. I even called the hotel again to confirm my reservation and it seemed to be ok. Anyway, maybe I was just unlucky but I just wanted to share my experience. If you want a very cheap hotel with a very good location and don´t have high expectations this hotel could be ok for a coupla of nights. If the thing with the card wouldn´t have happened maybe I could recommend this hotel. But since you only can book and pay on the internet I wouldn´t trust them again!If you book this hotel (or any other hotel over the net) check you account statements!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
17/09/09,"We needed a place to stay for one night between our other hotel and friends' in the country as we were going to a party in the city. I arrived with my wife and 200 bags and noted the man in reception found it amusing to watch us struggle, but not necessary to help us get through the door or up the very tiny staircase.We had our own shower, most other rooms did not. It's fine for a night if you don't need to be in your room for any period, especially at the price. Any longer and you may go mad. Our lights worked, our neighbours' lights did not. Our bed was like a trampoline, but not the nice kind. No aircon, no cleaning and the breakfast amounted to toast.Okay for a crash house, nothing more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
08/09/09,"Given my budget and my requirement to be close to the tube station, this place was perfect. If you're looking for the Ritz, dont' stay here. If you're looking for affordable accomodations in the heart of Central London, this is your place. Staying here allowed me to spend money on other stuff. London's expensive enough as it is.

A 2 minute walk from the Victoria station tha takes you everywhere in London and close enough to Buckingham Palace and Picadily Circus where we could just walk if we wanted. Service was great.

04/09/09,"I was in London this past weekend for a conference. This hotel was in a PERFECT location - right next to Victoria station. The service was great, the rooms were great, and I had access to wi-fi internet which was a huge bonus. And above all, the price was very, very reasonable. Other visitors for the conference were paying a lot more and didn't get the 1-on-1 service, had to pay extra for the internet, and were not as close to a tube station. Definetely great value for the price. Will stay here again next time I'm in town.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

11/08/09,"easily the worst hotel i ever stayed in. the first room I was shown into was basically a dosshouse bedsit - a scruffy, unusable kitchen with a put-you-up bed. the second bedroom I was given as an alternative (with shared bathroom despite paying for ensuite) lacked the oven but had nose-pickings on he wall by the bed to compensate. The matress was stained and broken, and there was a single (brown!) blanket on the bed. The hotel is dangerous and must transgress every health and safety regulation going. It''s truly appalling and despite arriving at midnight I was tempted to try to find another hotel - even walking the streets seemed a viable option. Staff however were not unfriendly and seemed to be trying to do their best in appalling circumstances.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
05/08/09,This is the most digusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. I was only there one night and that was enough. The room was disgusting and dirty. I was afraid to sleep in the bed it was that disgusting. No-one there understood a word of english. We were given the wrong times for breakfast so when we went down there in the morning at 8.55 and at 9.05 (after sitting there for 10 minutes) were told in an extremely rude mannor that we were not allowed breakfast as it was after the alloted time. We were told 9.30! Its was absolutely rediculous. Justy don't go there. Pay the extra money and get a half-decent nights sleep!,TripAdvisor,Belgrave
03/08/09,"The room was incredibly cheap: GBP 25/night. The value was incredibly good for this area of London, but it's a shame that they didn't spend the 10 pounds or so for a mattress pad to take some of the bite out of the crummy mattresses. That said, with the bed comfort being my only complaint, it wasn't a bad place.I have stayed in two other budget hotels in this area, and I would recommend one of the two over this one.Recommending this hotel solely on the rock-bottom prices for the rooms.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
06/07/09,"I stayed here last month, and after reading the reviews before I booked, i thought that this place would be a modern day &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. I only booked because of how cheap the place was, and was pretty chuffed at the end of my stay. The rooms are really basic and lack alot of amenities. But then again, this is a budget bdget hotel, and they dont make any claims to be anything other than. Its location is faultless, the hotel is clean, and the service is pretty standard - no concierge here!!!!I would definitely stay again, and would recomend this place if you are after a few nights of cheap sleep, and not much else.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

The room was grubby, the staff unfriendly, the breakfast room appeared ok. Aha I thought good until I tried the coffee, I think they made it the night before (it was more for surfacing the roads). The toast was probably reduced bread from a few days earlier. My window looked onto a roof from downstairs, it was littered with cigarette buts &amp; pigeon crap, I'm sure the beds had bugs as I came out in a huge rash which was very painfull.

It also had a square box with visible springs which must have been the bed, the window was single glazed and filled with muck and fossilised animals, the lock on the door was flimsy and falling apart, the bathroom looked like something out of a third world country and the staff were definately illegal immigrants...which is surprising as the UK Passport Office was only over the road! I think this is definately not a 'hotel', but more a 'half-way house' for illegal immigrants that are trying to get UK Residency!

03/02/09,London was our last stop on our sixteen day honeymoon across the United Kingdom. We were looking forward to a nice hotel that we saw in the ad on hotels.com.The lobby was okay looking. The guy who work in the hotel was not very friendly. Our room was on the fourth floor which was a bit annoying but hey everyone needs the exercise! When we got in to the room we found that we had only one towel for the two of us. A dirty bathroom. Some one had dumped some dark liquid down the sink. But the funny thing was the cleaning crew did come into the room before we enter cause they left their cleaning supplies in the room!The bed was uncomfortable. On the bed was just a sheet and a scratchy comforter and two flat pillows. The tea maker worked but they gave us two tea cups one had the handle broken. Towel they gave us were stained. Only good thing about the hotel was the location. It is in a quiet neighborhood near Victoria Station which allowed us easy access around London. Great pubs around it too. But you can choose another hotel on Belgrave Road.,TripAdvisor,Belgrave

One blanket on the bed which had 'gaffer' tape round ends of frame. Pest control box under the bedside table and the shower room - cannot descrbe it, only to say we did not shower the next morning, needed a health warning!!!Must admit only needed one blanket as the heating was on full blast and unable to control it!! The tiny TV did not work properley, not even a mug in bathroom for cleaning teeth. The Hotel was full due to time of year so could not get another room. Do not be fooled by the website photos.

Upon investigation, we found over flowing bins, dirty and stained sheets, mouldy food in the fridge and, much to our disgust, pubic hair all over the bathroom floor.We were a group of two young men and two young women, myself being 20 years old. I marched downstairs to complain, was met with a very unhelpful and arrogant receptionist who informed me I could not speak to a manager as there wasn't one at the weekend. I demanded a refund, was shouted and sworn at, at which we left the hotel and walked up and down the street around the hotel, looking for alternative accomodation.

The bed was a fold down camp bed &amp; the pillows were so lumpy that I had to support my head with my coat. The mattress had springs coming through which were proding your body. My room was on the main stair-well, this meant I was woken up almost on a nightly basis with people having to pass my room. The toilet was smelly, unclean &amp; in a terrible state of repair. The toilet very seldom flushed properly. The staff were unfriendly, almost bodering on untrusting. I would not recommend this youth hostel type of hotel to anybody.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
15/12/08,"I feel tricked, the pictures shown a their website only show the best parts of the hotel. The lobby looked very nice but you got a terrible shock when entering your room. The bathroom was really disgusting, looked like it had never been cleaned. The people who worked there didn't act very friendly. The TV didn't work so I was told that someone would come and fix it but nobody bothered to turn up.The money spent on the big TV in the lobby could maybe have been spent on some good beds and cleaning instead",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
24/10/08,"I stayed in the hotel with my wife from 19-22nd Oct. 2008. The front reception is the only good looking place in this so called hotel. They decieve people with a large screen tv that never works. The rooms are so small and with spring beds!. There was no toilet roll in my toilet. They did not put on the heater despite their promises that the boiler would switch on at 8.30 pm daily. On our last night, it was horrible. There was blood all over the hotel bathroom and the hotel staff were alerted in the night but nothing was done to clean it until about 9.30 am in the morning.For any complaint, the answer is that the place is for only bed and breakfast and they should not be bothered.The breakfast was basic with unfriendly staff at work.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

27/04/08,I stayed here at the weekend. After the first night I awoke covered in bites - at least 15 of them all over my body so the place must be infested. You wouldn't get that many bites from one or two bugs. I asked to change rooms but was told none were available. I asked for a refund so I could go and stay elsewhere but I was told by the receptionist that only the manager could issue refunds and that they didn't know when he would be in. I wrote down the complaint and left it at the reception along with photographic evidence. I have not heard anything yet regarding the refund. I had more bites after the 2nd night and they actually turned very nasty &amp; inflammed &amp; I had to go to hospital. I am a budget traveller and used to roughing it &amp; staying in hostels but I have NEVER experienced this before. My friend didn't get a single bite but regardless there are bugs of sorts in this hotel. The blankets on the bed were very old &amp; dirty. The hotel looked nice enough from the outside but inside is a different story. Please heed my advise and don't stay here!,TripAdvisor,Belgrave
23/04/08,"I took my daughter to london for her 16th Birthday. On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who was very friendly, giben our key and directions, well, heavy case and 58 steps later we got to our room. It was basic, tv and 2 beds with a pod style ensuite, (which was clean) the room was clean although probably could do with a repaint soon. the floor was laminated and clean. The beds were a bit old, matress was cheap but I slept ok (i have back problem and it did not get worse) but the pillow was a joke! I think they forgot to put them in the pillow case. Could not get any more seemed to be a language barrier at this point. Bedding is clean sheets and one doubled over blanket, although warm enough did not look very inviting.Breakfast was far too mad! we went down both mornings at about 8.30 and could not get in the room. we ended up eating in starbucks.On checking out we left cases in luggage cupboard, reclaiming them later with no problem.Possibly would use again but will have lighter case!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
15/04/08,"Absolute no go. Only the reception area is well decorated. the hotel is run by foreign expats who hardly know english. the reception guy was very rude, even passing wind whilst i was talking to him. to get to my room i had to climb a narrow staircase then go down again, then go through a a narrow corridor. room secured by a padlock. the bed was hopeless with springs going throughthe mattress. the central heating not working. hotel staff provided an electric fan. breakfast consists of hot water/coffee and a plain toast. i tried to get out but they would not give a refund. otherwise shower very clean and hotel very well located.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
14/04/08,"I had a great time at the BHH. The room was cozy (small). I received fresh linens everyday, had a shared bath, but never waited to use it. The price was right, cheaper than any other place near where I wanted to stay in London. The people at the front desk were very polite and helpful. The breakfast was a little on the weak side. Toast, coffee, and cereal were all I needed to start the day. The layout of the hotel was a little strange, no elevator and narrow staircases, but after a full day in London, a few more steps were not a problem.I would gladly stay there again. The price along with the location made this a good value. If you are looking for a safe and affordable place to stay in London, near a transportation hub(Victoria Station is less than a 5 minute walk) you will not be disappointed.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
01/04/08,"had booked to stay here for two nights, turned up the first evening,to be showed a dirty room, TV did not work and to top it all found bed bugs on the pillow! Went straight back to the reception with one of the bugs, and asked to be moved, only to be told there was no other room available for that night would have to sleep there and would be moved the next day, the man on reception took the bug said he would show the management, i think he just throw it away! I left to find something to eat feeling very down the thought of spending a night with bed bugs was just too much, luckly i found a hotel just down the road, and he had one single left, he showed me the room which was fantastic, they have just been totally refurbished and beautifully done and I was only charged £43 per night with full english breakfast. So went back to the other hotel to tell them i could not stay, and would like some sort of refund only to be told I would have to come back the next day to speak to the manager who would be there at 9;00 am. Went back as told at 9.00, only to be treated like dirt by a new girl on the reception, who had been warned i was coming in, she shouted at me and was rude said there was nothing wrong with their rooms and that the manager is never in on a sunday, as if i had made it all up. Anyway she called up the housekeeper, and demanded i went down to the room with her, to be shown there was nothing wrong, the TV still did not work the room still was dirty, as for the bugs well day time they do not come out, I asked her if she would pay to stay in this room, she said no,we then went back to the reception, to confront the girl on the desk, her answer was i had to write a letter to the management, to demande a refund, as she could not do so. I get the feeling I will never see my money back. DO NOT STAY HERE it should be closed down, if you are looking for a cheap place to stay thats clean go to the St Georges hotel down the road the normal price for a single is £45 worth every penny and more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
01/04/08,"To start with the good points. It is cheap and the location is excellent, just a few steps from Victoria station.We were three persons in one room. Old beds, cheap mattress. The ensuite was a joke, more a shower cabin with an included toilet and sink. All on 1 sqm!! A breakfast with cereals and toast was included. I will not stay there again altough the price of 60£ for three persons per night incl breakfast was ok. But consider cheap price, cheap accomodation. You get what you pay for.The next time I would look for a B&amp;B nearby.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
18/03/08,"The guy on reception was ignorant on every level, most unpleasant after a long flight from Thailand. When we saw the sub-standard dirty room we asked to be moved &amp; were told that no other room was available. So we decided to leave. We asked for the manager's name &amp; were refused it! So we left &amp; found a much nicer hotel. Eventually got the money refunded through lastminute. A bad hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
14/03/08,"Just got back from staying in the Belgrave House Hotel.You walk into the reception and think &quot; well yes this looks fine&quot;. Leave your aspirations there because it just went down hill FAST. Opened the door to the room and thought &quot;Oh my God&quot; Forget the pictures on the website. Was met with a view of filthy windows which looked out into the rear-paintwork was so badly neglected the wood was bare and lifted.Bed looked ok ,with a cobbled together sink unit in the corner,an open box which was supposed to be a wardrobe and a separate loo in which the tiles were broken anydwas minute.Thought ok it was only for one night. Returned to hotel after midnight and went to bed 2 of the thinnest pillows and 2 blankets on bed AND NO HEATING. Put excuse for a heater on and ended up putting our coats on the bed to try and get warm. (It was too cold to go and complain). Breakfast consisted of orange juice cornflakes and toast. (no choices of juice or cereal).Luckily the rest of our short trip to London was fantastic and would recommend the show Buddy and a restaurant on Buckingham Palace Rd called Bumbles top notch 3 course meal for £10!!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
08/02/08,"Me and 6 friends stayed in this hotel for the weekend, and the hotel was basic and a bit dirty, but I was bitten by bed bugs and ended up bringing them home with me. I have contacted the hotel several times to complain and I have never received any acknowledgement nor any apology. This hotel is cheap for a reason!!. The area was good and there is an easy hotel a couple of doors down. STAY THERE!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
19/01/08,"Do not stay at this hotel if comfort is of any importance to you. The mattresses were old, thin, and comprised of nothing but springs covered by some fabric. Consequently, you can feel every spring on your back. In three nights, I did not get a single good night's sleep because every time I would move, the springs rudely reasserted their presence abruptly waking me from my slumber. Additionally, the &quot;double bed&quot; my companion and I requested was two single beds pushed together, which is okay, but the configuration only added to the discomfort. They really shouldn't have bothered with the pillows considering they were about as thin as the sheet. At a minimum, this hotel should invest in some decent pillows to improve the service to their guests. Although, the rooms are non-smoking, a subtle but unpleasant odor of cigarette smoke permeated the room. We had an ensuite room, but the bathroom was so small, it was difficult to even turn around in it. It looked like one of those prefabricated bathrooms made for RVs, which was stuck into a corner in the hotel room. We had a TV, but one day it didn't work at all, and the other days, it received only four channels with pretty poor reception, two of which seemed to be airing darts tournaments 24/7.Beyond the lobby, the corridors and rooms look run down - do not believe the photos on the hotel website, which make it look modern and minimalist. Breakfast was spartan - choice of brown flakes or cornflakes, coffee or tea, and white toast with butter and jam, but I suppose that is to be expected with the cheap rate. Despite its numerous shortcomings, this hotel has two things going for it: Location, and cleanliness (as far as I could tell). So if you are on a budget and don't mind discomfort, this may be the place for you.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
18/01/08,"Accidently booked this hotel thinking it was the Belgrave Hotel in Oval-oops! As it was for only one night it didnt really matter though, however from the reviews Ive read I think that hotel is of a superior standard. Our room was small-barely room for a double bed and a wardrobe (containing a safe). A portable tv was provided with terrestrial. We saw a cupboard door in the wall that in fact turned out to be our en suite!-it was very much like a train toilet which caused us some amusement. It was moulded out of plastic and somehow contained and toilet and a shower! Toiletries were provided and the the shower was very powerful and water hot.The room was clean, apart from the blanket on our bed which had some cigarette holes in. (Luckily we didnt need it as the room was very warm).One thing I noticed was that as our room was on the the ground floor it would be very easy for someone to come in the window if we had had it open and this would be a concern in summer. It didnt seem the most secure of hotels. The breakfast was included-very basic tea/coffee, cereal and toast in what seemed like a newly decorated dining room.Location is excellent-literally round the corner from Victoria Station. Overall I would say you get what you pay for (£50 inc b/fast) but I dont think I could stay here more than a couple of nights as I found the room quite bland and depressing. Also I would have been concerned about leaving valubles there, despite the safe, but that just a personal opinion and I could've asked to change rooms. Its a bed for the night and not much more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
04/01/08,"Although this place is convenient, cheap, and fairly clean, if you don't like springs piercing your body all night-this is not the place for you. We spent 4 nights there-2 nights in one room and 2 nights in another room. We shared our room with friends and between all of these beds and rooms we did not get one remotely comfortable bed. It literally hurt to sleep due to the springs poking through and jabbing your body. Very uncomfortable. I have spent many nights camping and slept in various cheap youth hostels, but these beds take the prize for worst ever. Breakfast was also less than desirable.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
04/01/08,"Belgrave House Hotel has an excellent location with walking distances to a lot of places. Victoria St. is just around the corner.The hotel has a friendly staff, which is very helpful. I upgraded myself to a nice doubleroom with shower for at few extra pounds a day! The included breakfast with toast, coffee/tea and cereals is a fine start each day.The small, goodlooking lobby is wellprovided with brochures, maps and leaflets for all the sights and museums in London and area. The lobby has also automats in which you can buy soft drinks, beer, chips and chocolate.Some of the rooms are a bit worn out, but they are clean and good.I will properly stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
03/01/08,"This hotel is clean, and don't expect the Ritz, but the staff are friendly, its a chance for you to experience the real &quot;london&quot; and not the cookie cutter hotel experience (depends on what you like, I guess). There are shared bathroom facilities, and some rooms have their own shower inside, and when I stayed (4 nights in total) the bathrooms were always kept nice and clean, the beds were comfy with clean sheets, and I felt safe. Might I mention as well LOCATION! Its is just seconds away (on foot) from Victoria Station, shopping malls, bars/pubs, coffee shops, restaurants, theatre (for musicals, etc.), etc. etc. etc. Also close by (like a five minute walk or so) is Buckingham Palace and the Queens Gallery (please go see this Art work its AMAZING). So, for younger travelers or couples, this is a bargin and not only will you save money on your accomodations, you will save money on transportation too! PS Although we didn't get up early enough - breakfast is included in your stay at the Belgrave House Hotel too! That also saves some money! So, if you are wanting to go to London on a budget, this is the place for you. I've stayed at 5 star resorts in Jamaica before and at the best hotels, and really, as long as the bed is clean/room is clean, its safe, and in a GREAT spot, you can't go wrong. I gave the Belgrave an above average because you can't beat friendly service and a great location. The staff there let us stow our luggage and took it to our rooms for us (we arrived very early in the morning) so we could go site-seeing and not miss a day waiting around or dragging heavy luggage about. They offer any help they can give, and are very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is actually a large house/manner rennovated into a hotel, and lots of floors (no elevator) but not hard to find way around. Hope this review helps. PS go see the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; you won't regret it!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
22/11/07,"We stayed here for 3 nights in November. We were attracted by the good location and the no frills concept. Why pay more for all the friperies. Unfortunately, this hotel has got the basics wrong.For me, the minimum requirement is a comfortable and warm bed.... However, the bed frame screeched with every move, the matress had seen better days and I could feel the individual springs in my back, the pillow was approx 1cm thick giving my husband neck problems, and the sheet and blanket were insufficient to keep us warm through the night.After three sleepless nights, we were extremely happy to get back to our own bed.The rest of the hotel is fine - clean, but tired in some areas - very new in others. Breakfast was basic but sufficient.But I would not stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
30/10/07,"I booked a triple room for one night for £57 through last.minute. Don't be fooled by the lovely reception area! Me and my two friends kept saying to ourselves 'it's just somewhere to sleep for one night', however, the beds are like metal camp beds. The mattresses are thin and wires poking out everywhere - so uncomfortable! The pillows are so thin it wouldn't have made much difference if we were just led on an empty pillowcase! Breakfast is toast (white bread only) plonked down in front of you. And basic ceral if you help yourself. You have to ask for a drink, which is ONLY tea or coffee! The staff did not speak to us at all. I do not know if this is because they are all foreign or because they are just plain rude!The only good thing about this hotel is that it is a 5-10 min walk from Victoria stations.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
21/10/07,"Booked a single room on a website before visiting London.Worst hotel i have ever experienced there.Though it was mentionned on the website this hotel has been totally refurbished, i ended up in a small single room on the last floor with tricky stairs.Room was unclean and damp, with ceiling full of mould which was in a rather scary state, there was a noise of flowing water coming from room's next door al night, tv was not working properly, only one shared bathroom was gloomy and 2 floor downstairs.Staff was awfully rude and unfriendly, from eastern europe with hardly the basis of grammatical english : they also refused to serve me the included-in-price breakfast at 9 am in the morning, pretending it was too late, the waitress just made strange signs with her hands to me when i tried to get in the room for breakfast, like she would try to take away a dog that would steal in garbage/trashcan.I was shocked and complained to management, which didnt pay attention at all and left without having my breakfast,without having slept or excuses or refund.DO NOT EVER GO THERE, this place is dangerous with electric plugs too and should close down to my opinion ...",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
12/10/07,"Stayed at the 'hotel' a couple of days ago after looking at their misleading website. The website showed a well appointed room and said all others at the hotel were the same. Although I had been caught out before in this part of london I booked it. The room was like something from a kazakhstan brothel. Holes in the window, 60 year old bathroom, camping bed (etc). When I complained to the (probably vietnamese) desk guy he would not change the room or explain why the room did not match the website. Tried to find another hotel nearby but all booked. I am going to spend half a day now writing to trading standards (etc) to see what can be done about it.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
03/10/07,"I had to go to London twice in a month for one night stays so I was on a budget.The location is brilliant, it's a short walk from the coach and train station with a bus station and tube station within a 5 minute walk. I booked twice without checking it out first, but I was happy enough with the hotel not to cancel after the first visit. Although English is not the first language of the staff, I had no communication problems, and I was given all information on arrival from very friendly staff. The room was clean, small but not cramped. The first stay was just a bed and sink but the next time, for the same price I got two beds and a shower!Although it was a communal toilet, it was clean, with plenty of paper, but they could do with putting a towel and some soap in there as I had to go back to my room with wet hands and wash them again properly with soap.The mattresses could do with replacing, as they're a little worn, but the sheets were clean, even though you didn't get a duvet, just a sheet with a fleece throw over, which reminded me of a youth hostel. But it was quiet, and you get a peaceful nights sleep. The room also had a TV but it had poor reception, although it was still watchable. The room also had an interesting smell of cheap tortilla chips, sort of, corn and salt and some kind of cooking oil! Open a window and it's fine though.Breakfast is from 7:30-9:00 am, the first stay I went for breakfast I had a 20 minute wait for a table, but this was partly because a couple kept asking for more toast and coffee. They must have gone through a whole loaf, but this meant I was rushed. It was only toast and coffee and cereal if you wanted, and it's so close to food establishments the second time I stayed I went elsewhere for breakfast.Overall, it's not the best hotel, really it's almost a hostel, but for one or two nights it great, why spend more money when you just need a bed? I would definately go again but if I was staying in London for longer than a weekend I would go to a more upmarket hotel, because I can imagine it may get a bit depressing after a while.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
17/09/07,"This Hotels location is very good, quiet, central, clean, respectable. The reception is well kept and presented, and staff reassuringly friendly and generous with a smile, no complaint whatsoever, only some broken English. Beyond the reception area the decor is very basic and possibly in need of being retouched in places, however, everywhere was clean and tidy. The reasonably spacious room resembled an inexpensive bed &amp; breakfast, just meeting my basic requirements but rarely surpassing them. A sparsely furnished room with sink and colour television provided a functional rather than comfortable feel and meant 1 night was probably sufficiently bareable on my own. This is the kind of accomodation you would welcome a place to rest and could enjoy London, but little else. The mattress needed replacing but was okay, I slept well. Considering the price and the location I think it is pretty unfair to expect anything more realistically. If on a tight budget and not too fussy, probably worth considering.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
07/08/07,"Needed a hotel for three nights, relatively close to Central London. This hotel was cheap - compared to the fact that it's pretty centrally located and (in some rooms) had seperat toilet and shower.The bed was quite bad, with the madras being almost just a few springs with a thin cloth over them. The toilet and bath were only just clean enough but old and rundown.Of course a 24hour reception is nice, but the staff were for some reason not even able to provide extra toilet paper! Hair dryer was not in the room but could be borrowed against a deposit.&quot;Breakfast included&quot; - don't be fooled! That was the flimsiest excuse of a breakfast serving I have ever seen. Cerial with milk (not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products) and toast served with one small pack of jam and one small pack of butter (again... not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products). I think they served it to ensure that we would not take any more of it. I was hungry when I left this &quot;breakfast&quot;.But then, why two stars..? Well, we were in London to see London. The room was only to sleep in. And given the location it seems to be quite cheap compared to other hotels I could find.So if you consider booking a room here, my comment to you is: It's cheap, so expect nothing other than a cheap hotel!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
09/07/07,"Some of the other reviews are harsh. What do you expect for £30 - a 5 star hotel? Agreed it is not the most up to date decor, the carpets are a bit tatty and there are cracks on tiles in the bathrooms etc but so what? I found it to be perfectly adequate and exactly what I expected for the value - a clean and reasonably comfortable bed in a safe hotel and, contrary to other reviews, I found the staff to be helpful and perfectly friendly as long as you are courteous to them as well. There aren't many showers if you don't have en suite but they are absolutely fine and clean enough.I have stayed in better but not for £30 in the centre of London. I would stay there again if I was looking for cheap accommodation.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

When we arrived, the exterior and reception looked pleasent but don't be fooled. the receptionist spoke v.poor english and when we asked for information he declared that he did not know anything and that we would have to find out else where. Then we go tthe keys for our room from the bottom of the stair case there was a very strong smell of disifectant that made it hard to breath but at least it would be clean....it was not, it was awful the floor, sink and shower look like they have never been cleaned and the bed was basically made of springs it was v uncomfortable to sleep on we didnt put the cover over as it looked v unclean and roughed ..it 4 the night so didn't have to use the shower. The receptionist are very very rude i stood waiting for one of them to acknowledge me which they did not instead they carried on talking in their own language then walked away. We then got a drink from the machine and the nothing came out to which the receptionist replied i will not open it and you may not have your money back then walked away....it was AWFUL!

07/02/07,"I stayed in BHH for a week while looking for a place in London. I was working all day so didn't really bother to change hotels after (I hasd already prepaid). The hotel...I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The room, for which I payed £35 pounds per night (used to be £25 5 months ago!) was so small i couldn't even leave my luggage on the floor (a standard sized samsonite) and didn't have space for my 6 shirts and two suits on the available space either...The maitress was so old it actually hurt on my back, and I'm not very picky nor have trouble to sleep. The room was dirty and the window could not be closed properly, so it was pretty cold at night. But the last thing that definitely made me rate this place as HORRIBLE is that they have this &quot;policy&quot; for which if you forget something on the room, they basically keep it for themselves. I forgot my Ipod on my rush to get to work and realized at the end of the day...When I called at night asking if they have found it, they said the had &quot;thrown it away&quot; beacuse i had left it behind and they cannot keep anything guests forget. After being there for a whole week! The manager said to me &quot;Don't come back if you dont like it&quot; when I told them over the phone that this policy didn't make any sense...And tryed to make himself clear that they had trown the Ipod to the garbage and that it had already be picken up...Do they really expect me to belive this????? Belive me, with so many equally &quot;cheap&quot; options around...you don't want to be staying in Belgrave House Hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

24/01/07,"My girlfirend a I stayed in the hotel between 31st december a 2nd of January on order to see the newyear fireworks. The Hotel iswithin walking distance of victoria station...which is the best thing I can say about it as at least you have a quick route of escape!! The reception area is plush, with marbe flooring and modern decor, giving you an impression this is a clssy establishment.... BIG MISTAKE!!  We checked in, my girlfriend making the arrangements as the staff virtually ignored me. We were then directed to our room, next to the kitchen area and smelling of bacon and sauags constantly due to the paper thin doors.  The bed was of campbed standard, and the decor was falling apart The shower cubicle had mildew, and the last guest had left us a &quot;present&quot; in the toilet..... obviously hant been cleaned prior to our arrival. The first night we hardly got any sleep as the room was freezing! The radiators were turned off with the dial missing. I reported this to the reception, and was shouted at for not reporting it sooner! I asked if we could have an extra blanket, and was told no. I asked for someone to look at the radiator, and they told me the would bring down an electric heater. This took 2 days and 5 requests, and when it arried it was brand new ( me thinks they had gone out and bought it that day!) We had also paid for breakfast with our room, but did not use this until our final morning. Breakfast finished at 9am, and we arrived at 8:45. Breakfast was a bowl of cereal and coffee, but I had the bowl wrestled from my hands by staff who told me &quot;the other guests have eaten.... why sould you be special?!&quot;Cheap...... but certainly not cheerful.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

11/07/17, The receipetionest on the night that I check in the service of the staff is not friendly and not welcoming Secondly the receipetionest double check in me which mean he checked in me with a room that have another guest Moreover when I checked in my room is on the 5th floor but due to the renovation so I have to take the stairs the problem here is that I m having a lot of luggages with me it isn t the receipetionest should call a concerge to help me out But he didn t I have to ask for it Over the facilities of the hotel it s fine However staffs training it s still needed to be improve to match with the brand This disappointed me a lot   The cleaness of the room and the bed is comfortable The concerage guy is nice and helpful ,Booking.com,Euston
05/07/17, It was very noisy at the property Workmen were doing drilling and renovations right outside the breakfast room The sound made us leave rather than enjoy the breakfast offerings because it was so loud The hotel really should have asked the workmen to begin work in that particular area after breakfast service I understand that renovations need to be undertaken but more care should be taken in relation to guest comfort It was disappointing that nothing was listed on the booking com website or the Hilton website itself about the renovations taking place   The bed was comfortable and the room clean The wifi was strong and all of the staff members were lovely and welcoming The location being so close to Euston Station was absolutely brilliant ,Booking.com,Euston

30/05/17, My MAJOR problem with this hotel was that the wifi in my room only worked in a small corner close to the door This meant I had to work at the desk and type emails and do my business and then take my laptop and stand in the small corner until all my emails sent and updates were done Reception suggested I move to another room but that room was smaller with no work desk and really not what I paid for I specifically chose this hotel because it has a gym Nowhere on their website or in the hotel it shows that the gym is out of order but only when i changed and actually went to the gym there was a notice on the door Both these issues gave me such a bad impression of Hilton Euston London   It was very easy to travel from this location and the hotel seems to have a good standard at first glance and seems to be in line with other 4 star accommodation I liked the room and found it clean crisp and ideal with a desk to do work when I needed to ,Booking.com,Euston
25/05/17, The baggage man was rude asking us to find a better hotel in Mayfair just because we said it is a small room Be careful with the entrance 5 steps of stairs which you can not enter with your baby stroller Painting smell made me not sleep coughing no view to the street with small opening window Wifi is with fee costy hotel with no wifi access no nespresso machine even in Delux room only one elevator lift  ,Booking.com,Euston

08/05/17, If I had to be picky I would say the room could do with being a little bit bigger   I was impressed by how well sound proofed the windows were We were on the ground floor near the road and I was expecting to hear the traffic noise but it was nice and peaceful With the exception of an occasional police siren which you would hear on any floor Great location Was great being able to get the train to Euston on a Friday night and just walk across the road to the hotel Very handy for the tube and only a few stops to most of the main sights Staff Friendly and polite also held our luggage for us after check out which was a big help ,Booking.com,Euston
28/04/17, I decided to eat an evening meal at the hotel as my family were coming to meet me there It was not good at all I would not choose to eat there again The food quality was very poor   The room was small which was alright as I was on my own ,Booking.com,Euston

05/04/17, Whether it was because I booked through booking com I dont know but quality of room for a Hilton was poor The room I was allocated room 82 I think is next to cleaners store room they have no issues with slamming the hoovers out in the morning around 7am The bathroom was completed to a poor standard the shower screen didnt have a seal so water ran to the floor areas of skirting had paint drips from the walls Just looked and felt like a cheap hotel TV remote didnt work bulb out in lamp etc   The room was modern,Booking.com,Euston
27/03/17, I cannot think it was all great   Beautifull hotel in a great location breakfast was delicious and the presence of the chef who regularly checked the food was nice to see Friendly helpful staff and spotless comfortable rooms On arrival the staff member who dealt with check in was incredible helpful and went over and beyond to help me with an issue ,Booking.com,Euston

28/01/17, How close it was to the main road but not hotels fault it s nice for booking as constantly hearing sirens but that s London Didn t wake me up though 3 for a glass of coke in the bar should of had half a lager was cheaper but I am used to northern prices   Bed was comfy sunk right into it,Booking.com,Euston
26/01/17,  This was a last minute stay as we had to change from a flight from Southampton to a train from St Pancras for a New Year s break The hotel was picked for its location as a very easy walk to the international station It was clean comfortable and after a stressful day caused by fog cancellations and travel plans going horribly wrong we were very happy with our accommodation for the night ,Booking.com,Euston
24/01/17, The room is too small For the money I have paid I was expecting something just a bit more The internet free wifi was very slow Also the concierge did not answer to my phone call from the room I spent 15 20 minutes near the phone to ask a question It repeated not once seems that they have shortage in workers The breakfast was very poor standard poor quality english breakfast In addition the location is not good it is just on the road it does not have any bay for cars to drive in Was very difficult to catch a taxi because in front of the hotel the taxi could not stop by the law I did not like my stay at that hotel whereas I have paid a lot of money   The bathroom was very spacious and comfortable ,Booking.com,Euston

19/12/16, Front of house staff poor Very rough round edges Building work going on  When I told them I was working late and would not need breakfast as would be asleep to put me in a room next to the building work was terrible For a Hilton the level of service and state of the place was not 4 star If it was a franchise property not Hilton owned they simply wouldn t pass brand standards Not impressed at all and the staff blamed me for not telling them about it the night before when the building work didn t start until the morning Then offered me a free breakfast after breakfast was finished I should have suspected something when I checked in a couple came down saying they d been checked into a room that someone was in ,Booking.com,Euston
19/12/16, Prices for coffee in the lounge was as expensive as a pint of Guinness   Was perfect location we visited so we could get around to various areas Hyde park oxford street Camden etc and as this is located next to the station links are very easy and perfect for getting about even if you wanted to get on the tour bus stopped right outside ,Booking.com,Euston

20/11/16, Tiny shower with little water pressure no bath The tv didn t have a remote control which they remedied quite quickly Though part of our room service was fries and onion rings we weren t offered or given any sauces In the scheme of things these aren t a huge deal but you d expect a higher standard from a Hilton especially considering the price tag   Great location very comfortable bed ,Booking.com,Euston

14/11/16, I paid a lot of money for 1 night to be very dissapointed by the level of noise on Sunday morning I knew there was refurbishment going on in the hotel however I didn t know that I would be getting the room right underneath all the drilling and renovating On a Sunday to be woken at 8am by drilling was not nice and plus this was a surprise for my other half so I was a little embarrassed If there was a money back guarantee I would be asking for a full refund   I loved the breakfast choice in the morning and the closeness of the hotel to the station,Booking.com,Euston

07/11/16, Too much noise could be heard from neighbours and people chatting on the corridor the windows in our room weren t double glazed so the noise of blue light sirens disturbed us throughout night It was also quite cold as the heating wasn t on but I think this is due to ongoing building work   Beautiful room comfy beds Lovely staff,Booking.com,Euston
07/11/16, At check in the staff member seemed a little disinterested so wasn t overly enthusiastic at checking   I had stayed at this hotel before but since then seems like the rooms have been refurbished or are a lot more modern or maybe I got a better room this time Very nice d cor and the bed was very comfortable It is situated close to St Pancreas station so very convenient if you have just come off the Eurostar ,Booking.com,Euston
06/11/16, Cooked breakfast was poor Arriving for breakfast at 9am on a Friday morning there were no eggs left no baked beans no bread selection and the bacon had been under the heat lamp that long we couldn t physically cut it with a knife I would expect these basic items to be readily available without having to ask staff I notified reception that morning to receive little interest Very disappointing  ,Booking.com,Euston

25/10/16,  They windows are not isolated and we had the baby crib right to the window facing the street There wasn t a fireplace as showned on the pictures And the restaurant really needs a loving hand it looks horrible and old There should move the restaurant to the basement and have the breakfast served upstairs where there is light ,Booking.com,Euston
18/10/16, The bedroom was disappointing it was a disabled room so no bath The work desk didn t have a mirror so drying my hair and putting my makeup on was difficult as the mirror was in the bathroom nowhere near a socket It was also very hot the air con didn t work and there was no extractor fan in the bathroom Apart from that the room was very clean and the staff were very helpful   Breakfast was lovely location was perfect for what we wanted to do for the weekend ,Booking.com,Euston

10/07/16, Well it starts from the extremely dry unwelcoming and somewhat rude front desk staff and the non existing concierge I would have at least expected someone to ask me if i needed help with my bags since i had to deal with 5 of them Now after checking in we had to wait for around 10 minutes in a somewhat hot reception to get the service elevator since the other 2 are under renovation Everytime it stoped it was full of either staff of workers When we finally reached our floor it smelt like a worksite some airfreshners would have been nice The room itself is nice but was located near an emergency exit that woke us up everytime it slammed when closing Later that day after comming back from a walk we were then greeted by boxes almost blocking the hallways and minibars on the floors in front of everyroom this was followed by a maintenance person knocking on my door to check if he could install the fridge May i just point out that he must have been the most polite employee i encountered during my stay as he apologized for the mess and inconvenience Anyways im glad i only booked this place for one night I understand hotels renovate and need to work around guest but a few smiles some signs in the service hallways and a bit of courtesy doesn t hurt   The bed was comfy,Booking.com,Euston
07/07/16, Airconditioning didn t work We asked them to look into it someone came up and told that it would take some time Well it took until I left the room and the temp was still 26 7 C  Breakfast was good ,Booking.com,Euston

30/06/16,  The lobby staff were uncomfortably unhelpful and slightly rude This tarnished the experience for me as I ve stayed in many Hilton establishments prior and have never experienced this treatment The waiter and waitresses at breakfast were a different story however SO helpful polite and made us feel extra special and as though nothing was too much to ask for could do with passing some of this on to the desk lobby staff ,Booking.com,Euston

24/05/16, The view from our room was of their gymnasium which was being renovated and was basically a construction site See my photo of our view from the deluxe double room There was no natural light in the room There was a problem checking in as they couldn t find my booking even though I d already paid in full Took around 20 uncomfortable minutes for them to find my booking About half an hour after I d been in my room two men entered saying that they had the room Shocked that they had a key card and were able to open the door Very concerned about safety and security after that As a result of all of this I didn t think it was acceptable for over 300 for just two nights   Breakfast was great Exactly what I wanted The location was great and the room was clean The room in itself was fine but let down by the many negatives ,Booking.com,Euston
10/05/16, The room we were given had been having problems with the air con temperature but we were given it regardless we didn t know this on arrival We put the temperature down and went out thinking it would be ok when we returned it wasn t We got back at midnight and it was still like a sauna called down and that was when the staff member said they had been having issues He gave us an option of a cool down unit opening the window and lots of fans or we could swap to the only room left in the hotel Luckily I was there with my sister and we shared a room with a king size bed but it really was very poor of the hotel to book this room out knowing it was faulty  ,Booking.com,Euston

13/03/16, There was construction going on from 8am so don t expect a lie in We were told breakfast was on until10 30 which it was not and we missed it even though we had paid Due to the construction the lifts were out of order therefore being on the fourth floor we had to use the staff lifts which came out to a aged staff sink which was leaking The hall way was old and dated I e the paint was peeling off the room door The water was turned off in the morning whilst in the shower Was unable to finish showering or brush our teeth We weren t notified of this No concierge offered Very unhappy with our experience You could get a better experience elsewhere for this price I e Travelodge  Location was good ,Booking.com,Euston

23/02/16, There is scaffolding around the whole front of the hotel and was still being erected when we got there pending what looks like a good deal of work I feel we should have been advised about this prior to the booking being confirmed and possibly a discount offered considering the potential for disruption The initial room we were given was a single room with a double bed This was promptly changed to a standard double hence the excellent rating for the staff and service level The food also is excellent but the need to use the service lift and ongoing work means the hotel itself is not currently up to the standard I would expect from a Hilton in the heart of London with the rates expected   The staff and level of service was excellent,Booking.com,Euston
20/02/16, Woken up by building work in the next door room at 7am Dangerous plug sockets In room   Had a late room service who was very polite and food not bad for a limited 24hr menu,Booking.com,Euston

30/01/16, This hotel is currently undergoing a major refurbishment and should be avoided while this is underway The air conditioning had been switched off in my room and although a fan was supplied the room was stuffy and it was difficult to sleep I had to use a service elevator which was still being used for food deliveries etc The front of the building is covered in scaffolding which must raise security and privacy concerns While the refurbishment is under way much better idea to stay in the Ambassadors opposite or Premier Inn round the corner  ,Booking.com,Euston
20/01/16, there was nothing which I didn t like about the hilton   everything it is a fantastic place to stay the staff are eager to please polite and courteous the Hotel is spotlessly clean and well managed the bedroom was modern and bright with the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in the breakfast was 100 yum yum well done Hilton I look forward to seeing you again ,Booking.com,Euston
19/01/16, 1 Noisy from the street hotel maintenance work the church bells 2 The hotel is old building 3 There was maintenance work during my staying period in the hotel and supposedly the guest should be informed about that before check in date   location is nearby Eusten Station Regent Park ,Booking.com,Euston

25/12/15, The room was so stuffy and it stunk Couldn t open a window because the only window was looking into the restaurant Had to keep the shutters closed so no one could see me which left the room always dark I didn t know I was paying so much for a single bed The carpet was filthy I didn t want to walk on it without shoes The Internet was useless it shut off every 3 minutes and I had to type in the code again I used the Internet for probably 2 hours total and had to type in the code about 20 times I thought Hilton was supposed to be a decent hotel I was so suprized to have such an uncomfortable stay 200 Canadian should get me a lot more considering it wasn t even in a prime location   The location was decent,Booking.com,Euston
15/12/15, There was no plug socket near the mirror or no mirror near the plug socket which made drying hair a nightmare Also the shower door nearly chopped my fingers off as I think it was new and it shut with quite some force lovely shower though   Location and friendliness of staff We also thought the beds were really comfortable ,Booking.com,Euston
14/12/15, The hotel was undergoing refurbishment which we were not informed of in advance The bedroom we were allocated was stiflingly hot the window did not open and the air conditioning was not working The view was of builders rubble piled up outside the window We were allocated another room on the fourth floor accessed by a staff lift entered from a tradesman s kitchen with a exposed pipe running water down the sink The dining room was not open We had ordered afternoon tea for five people at 4pm for a family celebration We were told that tea was not served until 5 pm despite the website stating it was served from 2 30 to 4 30 and pre booking it for 4pm The website clearly advertised tea in a very nice looking dining room The staff did their best to accommodate us in the bar area but despite being there for two hours the staff then waited until my husband and I had gone to change before insisting that the tea was signed for by a person staying at the hotel or else paid for My daughter therefore paid for her celebration tea later reimbursed by us of course but that was not the point We were offered a bottle of Pinot Grigio White wine as recompense When we stated that we were intending to have glasses of sparkling wine in any event to mark her achievements the Pinot Grigio disappeared and we were charged full price for the five glasses of sparkling wine which was not the best quality in any event That was also on the bill which daughter paid We appreciate that it is difficult whilst renovations take place but the situation should be made clear when booking It was altogether unsatisfactory Had we known we would have stayed elsewhere  ,Booking.com,Euston
12/12/15, Would be good to have instructions on how to use TV gave up and went to sleep   Location was ideal for what we needed Staff went out of their way to help us Clean and friendly Nothing to much trouble Breakfast had lots of choices and hot and tasty Would stay again,Booking.com,Euston

03/12/15, The hotel had recently been refurbished so there was an overwhelming smell of paint The air conditioning was also not working so the hotel had put makeshift invidiual aircon units in rooms that when used can only be described as a plane taking off The heating was on high and couldnt be adjusted So overall a horrendous night When I complained to the manager the following morning although pleasant enough during his explanation that many people had complained due to the obvious issues the best he could offer me was a reduction on my next stay I decided to take him up on the offer given I needed 9 rooms for my staff for a company function Not only did they offer a measely 10 pounds per room but I discovered I could get the rooms for less on booking com Needless to say I shant be returning to this mobey grabbing hotel   Not much on this occassion,Booking.com,Euston

04/08/15, No air conditioning Bed was sunken and lobsifed Really hot ,Booking.com,Euston
03/08/17, Would have preferred a free standing shower bath very deep for a wee person like me to get in and out of   Room we were initially given was tiny bed against the wall and we couldn t even pass each other i complained got a free upgrade but looking at the advertised standard double room pic it was by no means an upgrade after requesting change this was immediate effect only drawback was that the Windows were not double glazed and there must be been a staff entrance below us view was an alley as the beeping entry system and chatting was quite loud also sounded like a building site nearby however this did not spoil our stay and we would return to Thistle lovely staff fab location ,Booking.com,Euston
03/08/17, Cleanliness of the bathroom This was a nightmare although the bathroom looked refreshed it was a bit dirty I think managers don t pay attention to detail and this is surprising At the end of the day this hotel have 4 and bathrooms should be clean Apart from that fire doors in the corridor on the 4th floor were noisy and it was hard to get some decent sleep as whenever people were walking in or out the doors were banging so loud that it was impossible to not get awaken   Location was good staff very friendly and very responsive Easy check in and check out Can t fault the service provided by reception staff as it was excellent Room was tidy not very good looking but for someone who needs to get some sleep should be enough If you re looking for some luxury or contemporary style then do not book standard double as you might be dissapointed ,Booking.com,Euston
03/08/17, Some noise I think from air conditioning system above the room but it wasn t bad enough to complain about or spoil the stay   The bedroom was clean and comfortable The breakfast was good value scrambled eggs were delicious If staying in London I would definitely stay there again ,Booking.com,Euston
02/08/17, Staff in the morning was alright staff at night for check in partially not so helpful Main issue bed was very uncomfortable and not good if you want to sleep in this hotel room 33 Rubbish bin was not emptied and contained still rubbish from previous guest Completely overpriced for the quality you get   The location is very good central close to train station ,Booking.com,Euston
02/08/17, The room was worn and requires updating The cleanliness was poor dirty carpet and skirting boards The bathroom was very small and difficult to move around the shower sprayed everywhere with no heated towel rail or fan to get rid of the condensation  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful,Booking.com,Euston
01/08/17, We struggled to regulate the room temperature and needed to open a window so that it was neither too cold nor too hot in the room Unfortunately the back side of the hotel is right across from the tracks and the station for the local trains and our window overlooked that it was noisy and nothing for a view The area itself is not the most attractive nor is it near places of interest It was disappointing that the small park adjacent to the hotel was permanently closed and under some sort of construction that green space would have added to and improved the location a little Owing to all of this I would consider the room a bit pricey   The hotel is well appointed and the staff exceedingly helpful The women at the front desk assisted us in booking the Hop on Hop off tour provided transit information and made great suggestions for activities that might interest us Our room was spacious for London and the breakfast buffet delicious The proximity to the underground and local trains was excellent ,Booking.com,Euston
21/07/17, booked on line with credit card was asked to show it on arrival have NEVER been asked before l didn t have it worry about it being stolen have stayed here 6 times the manageress could not give me a reason just kept on and on no apology if we had cancelled or not arrived the fee would have been taken my sister had a card but not the point could we have been turned away spoilt the start of our stay and put me off staying again Nothing on the site mentions this   the room and the predone toast no silly machine to deal with and wait for,Booking.com,Euston
20/07/17, Mostly good size of bathroom could have been larger  Room was small but adaquate the bathroom very small but an excellent shower over the bath Had a sandwich for lunch that was tasty and reasonable Breakfast was 12 per person but again excellent Location so close to Euston station Staff friendly and helpful would definitely stay there again,Booking.com,Euston
18/07/17, Have nothing bad to say   Room was lovely and a good price Super clean Close to Camden Bed was very comfy Breakfast was good for the price If I m ever back in the area I d happily come back ,Booking.com,Euston
18/07/17, The shower wasn t that clean and the bed was very hard   Good location good breakfast Staff are friendly and professional and the hotel has a good feel about it ,Booking.com,Euston
16/07/17, Not having an accessible room to accommodate my disabilities  My requirement was an accessible room as I am disabled but the only one they had was occupied The alternative was totally unsuitable and the promise of a chair for the shower did not materialise My visits to London are for hospital appointments and I did not have time to try and find another hotel It would have cost another fortune with it being Wimbledon Tennis time I paid a lot for a substandard room that was not accessible The room given was immediately next door to the life there versions of an alternative accessible room I will never rely on this hotel again and feel totally disappointed that my needs were dismissed so lightly Even if a chair had been provided for in the shower I could not have a shower as there were no grab rails Appalled at the reaction on arrival as they tried to blame me dispicable ,Booking.com,Euston
16/07/17, The receptionist When I checked in I told her I m on my business trip and need some printings and don t mind to pay But she keeps saying she is busy but actually nobody on the queue for checking in and keep mention about the cost Don t like her attitude   The bath,Booking.com,Euston
16/07/17, The room was far too small Very poor value for money Wouldn t use this hotel again for that reason   The double bed was hard up against the wall The room could hardly be described as a double room ,Booking.com,Euston
16/07/17, The queue for reception was long and slow moving on arrival with only two staff on the desk We had to ask for directions to our room time of breakfast etc as this information wasn t offered A fridge in the room would be a welcome addition It was a very warm July weekend and cold rather than lukewarm water would have been good   This hotel is conveniently located around the corner from Euston Station making it easy to get to and a great central location when traveling around London Hotel room was clean and a decent size with a good range of facilities and housekeeping responded promptly when we requested more coathangers ,Booking.com,Euston
09/07/17, The wifi was poor A speedtest at 12am so few should have been using it showed 2 6mb down and 0 2mb up Had to give up and just use 4G tethered from my phone   Comfy beds pillows in a spacious clean room The shower was phenomenal like showing under a waterfall The best shower I ve had in 34 years We only stayed one night so can t comment on all aspects including the restaurant breakfast ,Booking.com,Euston
08/07/17, That we didn t have enough time to stay longer   The staff and service crew were very accommodating and friendly They went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and welcome Clean comfy and the food servings were large and very tasty Thank you for a wonderful stay ,Booking.com,Euston
06/07/17, Rooms were student dorm like student dorm from 60 s that need a refresh Very basic service for the price prob a bad day for the staff or something  Convenient place to park and stay in London,Booking.com,Euston
05/07/17, The size of the room was a bit small hard to get around the bed as you walked in and the bed was way too hard for me   Location is fantastic right by the trainstation and no matter where you want to go in London ,Booking.com,Euston
04/07/17, Creaky floors long corridors and inefficient lifts  The room was clean and reasonable sized for this part of lounge the aspect was pleasant and quiet Bar staff were pleasant and obliging ,Booking.com,Euston
03/07/17, The room was tiny and the bathroom was dirty I requested with plenty of notice a room with a view as it was a special trip for me and my wife I was on the first floor and when I finially managed to open the dilapadeted metal window I had a large tree in front of me and a active building site The toilet keep flushing on its own I reporteed this to the reception below and was told we will get someone to look at it on Monday I was checking out on the Sunday so this was not much use to me   It was close to the train station ,Booking.com,Euston
02/07/17, Hotel was dated Our room door could of done with a new lick of paint and was narrow compared to other hotels we have stayed in I paid nearly the same price in Tokyo and the hotel rooms was far more nicer Rooms are fairly small for the price Bathrooms you couldn t swing a cat in Ordered a baby cot when on booking but when we turned their was no cot in room When we enquired they said you need to order on booking They said they would get one from another hotel but girl on reception seemed reluctant and she had a attitude the cot delivered wasn t a cot it was a play den Hotel lifts were VERY small and slow In general we will not be staying here again for 200 night Worst hotel ever A depressing return to the UK   Breakfast was very good and helpful staff Bed was comfy ,Booking.com,Euston
01/07/17, The room was noisy I had asked for a quiet room The TV didn t work properly The toilet made a strang mois when flushed and the wardrobe door wouldn t shut so the light was on all night I had to wedge it with the ironing board When I told he staff next morning they said I should have asked to move rooms but all this only came to light Lat on hen I was going to bed   Location is good,Booking.com,Euston
30/06/17, Room is pretty small Although the bathroom is quite spacious the shower door and shower nozzle are rather problematic thus not a good showing experience Bad wifi signal not sure if it s because our room is on the edge   Wonderful location Less than 5 minute walk to Euston station Also has a bus stop nearby ,Booking.com,Euston
28/06/17, Total confusion with keys rooms check in on breakfast charges Staff were beautifully polite and friendly   Eggs were great Total confusion with keys rooms check in on breakfast charges Staff were beautifully polite and friendly but mostly seemed new and not trained and not really fluent in English Do you pay very low rates and attract young people from areas of high unemployment who don t realise how expensive london is ,Booking.com,Euston
28/06/17, The road is currently under construction so it was rather difficult getting to them But this should be corrected when they finish the road work and if you haven t a car probably won t notice   Accommodated all my requests needed fridge easy access room Room very pleasant has air conditioner which was great since it was so hot and humid Comfy bed fluffy towels pleasant staff who speak many languages Btw there is a very pleasant park right next store Most importantly within close walking distance to train station,Booking.com,Euston
27/06/17, The room itself looks nothing like advertised in the pictures the lobby looks amazing but the rooms look like they haven t been renovated since the early 20th century very professionally done photos on the booking com website It was very loud in the hotel by that I mean the rooms were not at all soundproof you can hear people talking in the room next door and you can also hear every time they would close the door as it would end with a loud bang probably because of the door hinges Believe me I can sleep through anything and am not a light sleeper but this was loud The bathroom was terrible as it was hard to get warm water it was either scalding hot or freezing cold and the bathtub itself was clogged so you would be showering with scalding hot water while standing in freezing cold water   The staff was pleasant and helpful and the room service was decent ,Booking.com,Euston
26/06/17, Told us our room was far from the lift but did not tell us there was a flight of stairs to negotiate with heavy cases was hard to get extra milk and tea bags also was very hard to contact them on the phone we stayed here 3 years ago and had a far better room this visit was very disappointing  Great location,Booking.com,Euston
25/06/17, Beds were pretty hard and not very comfortable Contruction works were ongoing besides the hotel Very busy breakfast area and breakfast was not always filled up once empty   Very helpful staff Location is close to Euston railway and subway station 10 15 min walk to Camden ,Booking.com,Euston
25/06/17,  Lovely comfortable bed plenty of pillows great tea and coffee making facilities lovely small Nespresso machine Nice small bathroom and lovely toiletries Friendly welcoming staff and quick check in procedure Great service lovely small single room fantastic choice at breakfast including ample tea and delicious pastries perfect for a weekend stay in London ,Booking.com,Euston
22/06/17, Bar was a little disappointing Mistake made with lunch order cracked glass companions meal not served at same time as mine no apology   Reception staff lovely helpful ,Booking.com,Euston
22/06/17, Breakfast would stay again but would eat breakfast elsewhere in future Everything self service Coffee machine too complicated to work many people gave up and didn t bother When eventually i asked a waitress how to work it she took ages getting it to work and then the coffee tasted awful when i did get it Food was average As i said before i would definitely stay again as overall was a pleasant experience   Great location Fantastic night s sleep comfy bed no noise soundproofed walls air conditioning kept the room at a constant temperature rather than getting too cold too blowy ,Booking.com,Euston
21/06/17, The room was dingy and did not smell very fresh The air conditioner was noisy The mattress was hard Although clean and reasonably well appointed the bathroom was tiny   The response staff made to some problems with the room safe locked shut door card did not activate light switches They sorted these out immediately and professionally The brasserie menu was quite varied and the lighter meal I chose was good value ,Booking.com,Euston
20/06/17,  The location was very central great for the conference I was attending Reception staff extremely friendly on arrival and departure Very comfortable bed ,Booking.com,Euston
20/06/17, The shower and bathroom were a little cramped and my wife would have preferred a flexible shower head not a fixed one as we had in our shower We found the restaurant a little noisy and looking a bit 60 s I think it could do with a revamp   The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were good too The breakfast was very good ,Booking.com,Euston
19/06/17, Nothing  The beds and bedding were very comfortable I had a very good nights sleep Excellent facilities very clean modern hotel I shall most certainly stay at the Thistle Euston again ,Booking.com,Euston
19/06/17, The staff at the breakfast can genuinely be a little more friendly   Liked everything about it But not the first time being at the hotel I ve been there previously And as always it was very much worth it ,Booking.com,Euston
18/06/17, Breakfast room is very small and does not accomodate customers The restaurant is in the basement and food is regular and does not match their posters Room is small for the price  It is close the Euston station Next time I may consider going to IBIS ,Booking.com,Euston
18/06/17, There was nothing we didn t like but one comment would be to place tea and coffee making tray on the table instead of in drawer it s not obvious where they are even though drawer front says it s there I read a review prior to booking so remembered to look   Very easy to get to from the tube lots or power points in convenient places around our spacious room Informative staff when enquiring how to get to places to visit My granddaughter and myself e njoyed the whole experience ,Booking.com,Euston
13/06/17, My room overlooked a park where drunks gathered I was charged 176 just in case so I have been deducted 3 amounts for 2 rooms and I am still waiting for a refund No mention was made of tis on check in   The bed was comfortable ,Booking.com,Euston
12/06/17, The breakfast was good but at 12 per head there could have been far more of a personal service The tables were small and we had to ask for the tea It was very busy but some of the staff could have been more attentive   The room was of good size for London though the bathroom was small The bed was very comfortable It was very handy for Euston Station so only a few stops from the centre of all we wanted to see and do ,Booking.com,Euston
08/06/17,  Comfy beds lovely bathroom great location The staff where lovely in the restaurant and couldn t do enough to help same with reception staff Everyone we came across in London where so helpful it really made our stay,Booking.com,Euston
05/06/17, check in was overlong as staff were pre occupied giving theatre and travel directions to other guests At the end of day 1 on a 2 night stay my key cards were cancelled and I had to queue again to check in all over again Not good front facing room on first floor suffered noise from traffic and roadworks outside   good size room and bathroom Natural light tea and coffee and ironing board supplied comfortable bed ,Booking.com,Euston
04/06/17, Non existent room service reception and concierge Was ringing for hours with no reply had to go down 4 floors to find staff and even then I was looking everywhere Not good for health and safety at all ,Booking.com,Euston
02/06/17, Mold on the bathtube dirty carpets cracks in the windows window view on the AC devices and dirty wall The pictures absolutely do not reflect the reality Such a hotel would have maximum 3 stars in Poland I m going back to London soon but will choose another hotel   Quiet room quite comfortable beds ,Booking.com,Euston
01/06/17, Credit card pre charged so unable to change it on arrival Air con completely inadequate on what was the hottest night so far this year Room decor very tired   Pleasant welcome convenient location ,Booking.com,Euston
01/06/17, Would have liked more milk in our room Never thought to request more at the time   Our room was quiet previously we were quite close to the back of the lifts so we re disturbed during the night Can t fault our stay this time,Booking.com,Euston
30/05/17, bathroom tidy and clean but not as up to date as bedroom in terms of d cor  bed very comfy and huge we were upgraded for free room had a nespresso coffee machine nice touch,Booking.com,Euston
29/05/17, Cleaning service is shocking Cleaners get rid of things from specific surfaces and that includes personal belongings you don t want chucked When I rang to find out what happened the housekeeping hung up   Comfy bed,Booking.com,Euston
29/05/17, I booked on 2 individual bookings which reception converted into a 1 room booking for two nights Appreciated However on the second day returning at 7 pm tired my keys were cancelled and I had to queue again to have this fixed at reception That was poor Queuing times at reception on Friday afternoon were overlong as staff were spending too much time giving travel directions and theatre advice to customers leaving once lady to check the queue in A quick check in after a tiring day travel is appreciated Room 104 at the front was noisy with traffic after 7 a m Onwards including buses arriving to pick up tourists at hotel   Property is in very good location adjacent to Euston station It is also within walking distance of Camden market Good sized room and bathroom tea and coffee provided as is an iron ironing board and hair dryer and toiletries Comfortable King size bed for 2 night stay I booked on 2 individual bookings which reception converted into a 1 room booking for Two nights and that was appreciated Bar was ok for a late night drink ,Booking.com,Euston
29/05/17, The room and bathroom were both a little cramped and there was some noise from construction work nearby   This was a nice hotel convenient for Euston underground station which was a few minutes away and had great links to eg Trafalgar and Leicester Squares Embankment London Eye Westminster etc,Booking.com,Euston
24/05/17, Took 30 mins to check in the walls are paper thin and it was impossible to sleep raised both issues with staff and to be honest they were not bothered at all The bar was awful staff bickering started serving me and then got distracted 3x and did something else On another table someone called a waiter over so the waiter went to get the hotel manager it was all very embarrassing   Showers Breakfast were good,Booking.com,Euston
24/05/17, Bathroom door s lock was not there Guess it was broken but they did not get it fixed and gave us the room without checking Service at the restaurant was super slow with hardly few guests around  ,Booking.com,Euston
23/05/17, When I arrived it was simultaneously with a large group that arrived at the same time The line up was huge and the small reception area was like a zoo noisy and unorganized It took me a while to find the place so after a bunch of walking coming to a lineup and noisy reception area wasn t the greatest start to the stay I m not sure what other rates are for hotels in London but it seemed a bit expensive for what was provided   I enjoyed the expresso coffee maker in the room I found the room very clean and actually noted the bath towel was extra large and fluffy nice I liked the fact the room was energy efficient and the king size bed was ample I appreciated the friendliness of the cleaning staff as everyone of them said hello when passing by A small thing but added to the friendliness of the hotel I found the proximity to the underground Euston close enough to walk to making coming and going easy throughout the 3 days there ,Booking.com,Euston
23/05/17, The room and the bathroom were quite small and we had to allow each other room to pass as if 2 people pass the bottom of the beds together it s quite a squeeze However I ve stayed in smaller rooms and so it wasn t an issue   Ease of check in and out and very importantly enough electrical sockets in the room Too many hotels don t have enough sockets and as my husband has to sleep with a machine to help him breath through the night as he has sleep apnoea we frequently have to use the one socket for that and also ask for an extension lead as no sockets near the bed Thank goodness Thistle have sockets in usable and practical places so I can charge my iPod and iphone and my husband can sleep with his machine plugged in Enough lamps too I hate having to use overhead lighting in bed but we had a bedside lamp so that was good too There were 2 decent armchairs too ,Booking.com,Euston
