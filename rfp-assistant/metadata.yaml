long_description: |
  The RFP Assistant is an AI-powered solution designed to eliminate the inefficiencies of traditional RFP workflows. 
  Instead of teams spending days manually tracking procurement portals, copy-pasting boilerplate content, and struggling 
  with formatting, the assistant automates the entire process â€” from discovering relevant opportunities to generating 
  polished, ready-to-submit proposals. It uses semantic search and intelligent ranking to surface the most aligned 
  RFPs based on a company's strengths, and produces structured responses including executive summaries and 
  capability mappings - all through natural language queries.
