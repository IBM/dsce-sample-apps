Use a JSON blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action input key (tool input). 

Use only valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names} and provide only one action per $JSON_BLOB. Use "action" value "Final Answer" if you know what to respond. Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:
```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```
Follow this format:
Question: input question to answer
Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: action result
... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
Thought: I know what to respond
Action:
```
{{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "Final response to human"
}}

Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid JSON blob of a single action. Use tools only if necessary. Format is Action:```$JSON_BLOB```then Observation
