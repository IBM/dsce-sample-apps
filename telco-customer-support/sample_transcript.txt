John (Teltop Customer Care Agent): Hello, this is John from Teltop customer care. How can I assist you today?
Mary (Disappointed Subscriber): Hi John, it's Mary again. I've been having a nightmare with your service. My home Wi-Fi is acting up, and the TV service over fiber is terrible.
John: I'm sorry to hear about the troubles you're facing at home, Mary. Let's address these issues. Can you provide me with more details about the Wi-Fi problems and the TV service quality?
Mary: The Wi-Fi keeps dropping, and the TV service over fiber is pixelated and glitchy. It's making it impossible to enjoy any show or movie.
John: I understand how frustrating that can be, Mary. Let me check our system to see if there are any reported issues in your area. What's your email and postal address ?
Mary: mary@gmail.com I am at 21 Baker Street

(John checks the system and finds no reported issues in Mary's area.)

John: Mary, it seems there are no reported issues in your area. It could be a specific problem with your equipment or connection. Can you check if all cables are properly connected and if there are any obstructions to the router?
Mary: I've checked, and everything seems fine. This is so frustrating!

John: I'm sorry to hear that, Mary. It might be best to perform a remote diagnostic check on your router. I can guide you through the process.
(John guides Mary through the diagnostic check, and it reveals some issues with the router.)

John: Mary, it appears there are some issues with your router. We can arrange for a technician to replace it for you. Additionally, I'll address the TV service quality. There might be a signal issue or equipment malfunction.
Mary: Finally some answers! When can the technician come, and how soon can you fix the TV service?
John: I'll schedule a technician to come to your place within the next two business days to replace your router. As for the TV service, our team will work on it immediately, and you should see improvements within the next 24 hours.
Mary: Well, it's about time! I hope this gets sorted out.
John: I appreciate your patience, Mary. To make up for the inconvenience, I'd like to offer you three months of free TV service once everything is resolved. Does that sound fair?
Mary: That's more like it, John. I appreciate the offer. Let's hope the technician and your team can fix these issues once and for all.
John: Thank you for understanding, Mary. We're committed to providing you with a seamless experience. If you have any other concerns or questions, feel free to reach out.
Mary: Thanks, John. I'll take the offer for the free TV service, and let's hope things get better soon.
John: Absolutely, Mary. We appreciate your loyalty, and we're here to make things right. If there's anything else, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!
